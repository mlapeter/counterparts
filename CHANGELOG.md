# Changelog

## 0.3.1 — unreleased

A small release of fixes. No change to the store's format, so no migration and no
Reconnect.

- **Cards for people, places and the identity core are no longer archived after about
  90 days of use** (#215). The nightly cleanup was treating them like ordinary memories.
  They now fade only through a gentle phase of their own: months of quiet on both the
  lived and the calendar clock (180 days, 365 for people), never while beliefs still
  hang on them, and never the identity core. Nobody's store is old enough to have been
  hit, which is why this ships now.
- **A faded card comes back when a saved memory names it** (#220), and **a card named
  in a saved memory counts as used** (#218), so the people and things you still talk
  about stay live.
- **Prompts typed while Claude is still working are saved** (#213). They were missed
  before, about one typed prompt in twelve.
- **A checked snapshot is taken before any change to the store's format** (#214). If the
  copy can't be made, the change waits. `doctor` shows a store that needs one: red when
  the copy can't be made, amber when it can.
- **Each journal chapter records the model that wrote it** (#217).
- **`counterparts fired` and `doctor` show fading** as a mechanism of its own.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-24

No API keys: nothing leaves the machine except through Claude Code. A quieter end-of-turn
ask, paced by what you type. `counterparts ask` searches by meaning.
