# Changelog

## 0.3.2 — unreleased

Dates and times follow your clock, and the store's format moves to v7.

**Before upgrading, close every Claude Code session.** The first session after the upgrade
saves a copy of the store and then updates its format; a session left open is still
running the old memory server, so in any you missed, run `/mcp` and choose Reconnect.

- **Your day is your local day.** The day a memory was learned, "today", and the dates
  in `doctor` and `counterparts fired` now use this computer's time zone instead of UTC,
  so a memory saved at 11:50 pm belongs to that evening. Memories saved before keep the
  dates they have. A `timeZone` setting in the config (for example `"America/Denver"`)
  pins a zone, for a machine set to UTC; install says which zone it found.
- **Sessions know what time it is.** The wake opens with a line like
  `Now: Fri 25 Sep 2026, 1:40 pm MDT`, and each turn that recalls something carries the
  current time too.
- **Each memory records when it was written and changed, and which model wrote it.**
  Notes, end-of-session memories, journal chapters and the self page carry the model the
  session was using.
- **The store can hold a reminder's date** — a day, a month, or a range like
  `2026-10-20..2026-10-31` — ready for reminders to use in a later release.
- One module now does every date conversion, and a test keeps it that way.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-25

A small release of fixes. No change to the store's format, so no migration and no
Reconnect.

- **Cards for people, places and the identity core are no longer archived after about
  90 days of use** (#215). The nightly cleanup was treating them like ordinary memories.
  They now fade only through a gentle phase of their own: months of quiet on both the
  lived and the calendar clock (180 days, 365 for people), never while beliefs still
  hang on them, and never the identity core. Nobody's store is old enough to have been
  hit, which is why this ships now.
- **A faded card comes back when a saved memory names it** (#220), and **a card named
  in a saved memory counts as used** (#218), so the people and things you still talk
  about stay live.
- **Prompts typed while Claude is still working are saved** (#213). They were missed
  before, about one typed prompt in twelve.
- **A checked snapshot is taken before any change to the store's format** (#214). If the
  copy can't be made, the change waits. `doctor` shows a store that needs one: red when
  the copy can't be made, amber when it can.
- **Each journal chapter records the model that wrote it** (#217).
- **`counterparts fired` and `doctor` show fading** as a mechanism of its own.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-24

No API keys: nothing leaves the machine except through Claude Code. A quieter end-of-turn
ask, paced by what you type. `counterparts ask` searches by meaning.
