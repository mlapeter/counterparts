/**
 * The REVISION seam — SEAMS.md item O closes here.
 *
 * `mint.ts` is where a proposal becomes a memory. This file is where a memory
 * that ARGUES WITH ANOTHER ONE actually lands. The two are deliberately
 * separate: minting is unconditional (the memory exists either way), and
 * revising is a dispatch on what the declaration hit.
 *
 * **The gap this closes, measured 2026-09-04 on the live store.** The surprise
 * pipeline dissented and the dissent went nowhere. The sweep declared a revision
 * against a shown card; `remember/` resolved it; `mint.ts` wrote
 * `doc.meta["updates"]` and routed the claim through the freeze seam — and then
 * nothing. `encode/chunk.ts` emits a `revision.challenge` DurableEffect that no
 * consumer applied, and `Schemas.challengeBelief` — the pressure accumulator,
 * the durable `revision.pressure` events, the supersede past the bar — had
 * callers only in test files. Store-wide, for the store's whole life: zero rows
 * with pressure, zero `last_challenged_day`, zero `superseded_by`, zero
 * `versions` rows, zero `revision.pressure` events. `self/freeze.ts` says a
 * softening leaves "the revision path (physics' pressure accumulator) ... the
 * caller's next stop, unimpeded". The caller was never written. This is it.
 *
 * **The dispatch table (owner ruling, Mike, 2026-09-04).** What a resolved
 * `updates:` may do depends entirely on WHAT IT HIT:
 *
 *   | target                                   | what happens                    |
 *   |------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
 *   | schema BELIEF element                    | PRESSURE (`challengeBelief`)    |
 *   | identity element (band identity /         | PRESSURE, same arithmetic, same |
 *   |   `promoted_identity`)                    | durable event shape             |
 *   | schema CURRENT-STATE element ("now" fact) | REPLACE now, with lineage       |
 *   | schema ENTITY row                        | link only — an entity dies by   |
 *   |                                          | decay and no model rewrites one |
 *   | any other memory                         | link only (`meta.updates`)      |
 *   | protected element                        | REFUSED, on every path          |
 *
 * "One declaration adds pressure; the element is superseded only when the bar is
 * crossed; the old version is retained with lineage" (constitution 7) — that is
 * the slow half. A current-state row is the fast half by construction: a "now"
 * fact that is corrected is simply wrong now, and world-state should flip on one
 * clear correction (§4.3). Everything else links and moves nothing, because
 * `meta.updates` already records the relation and a supersede would be a claim
 * the declaration did not make.
 *
 * **Three rules this file states, all of them inherited, none of them new:**
 *
 *   1. **A CONFIRMATION IS NOT A CHALLENGE.** The direction is read off the
 *      matcher's own verdict through `mint.directionOf` — the same function, not
 *      a second reading — and only a `soften` reaches the pressure path. Without
 *      this, the engine matching a RESTATEMENT by content (`content` /
 *      `content+hint`) would push a belief toward being superseded by its own
 *      paraphrase, and `physics.dedupVerdict`'s first check and this dispatch
 *      would disagree about what a declaration means (SEAMS N, scar §2.10).
 *   2. **Authored beats swept, through the physics and not through a second
 *      weighting.** Force is `strength(challenger) x sal(challenger)`, and a
 *      fallback challenger's claimed salience was already cut to
 *      `SWEEP_CLAIM_CEILING` at the minting seam. A sweep therefore pushes less
 *      hard than the experiencer, arithmetically, and nothing here re-weights it.
 *   3. **Refusals are RETURNED and EVENTED, never thrown.** A door that mints
 *      must not fail because a declaration pointed at nothing (§5 G10). Every
 *      outcome names its ground; the declaration itself is author content and is
 *      logged as a HASH (schemas NOTES §11).
 *
 * **Effect/apply agreement (encode §5 G3).** `encode/chunk.ts` emits one
 * `revision.challenge` effect per accepted proposal whose declaration was
 * non-null — BEFORE resolution, because encode resolves nothing. So this
 * function is called once per such declaration, resolved or not: an address that
 * resolves to nothing produces a countable `target-unresolvable` refusal rather
 * than silence, and the effect list and the applies stand one for one. A fully
 * gated chunk produces no accepted proposals, hence no effects and no applies;
 * an observer's chunk produces neither, and this function stands down on its own
 * besides.
