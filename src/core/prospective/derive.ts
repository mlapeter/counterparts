/**
 * Derivation — **prospectivity is DERIVED, never stored** (§12 G2).
 *
 * There is no `isProspective` flag anywhere in this module, no column that says
 * so, and no author who can set one. Eligibility is a pure predicate over the
 * event date, the encode date, salience and flags, recomputed every time it is
 * asked. Three consequences, all of them the point:
 *
 *   - the property EXPIRES BY ITSELF when the window passes — no cleanup pass;
 *   - there is no second source of truth to drift from the memory;
 *   - decay has nothing to special-case (§12 G10: no decay exemption before
 *     arrival — a future-dated memory that faded before its window was an
 *     occasion that didn't matter) — save one carve-out: a date that still
 *     REPEATS is not refused `faded` (review of #341, 2026-10-09).
 *
 * The dates come from the CALLER. This module does no NLP: it reads the shape of
 * a date string and nothing else (`windows.ts`). Whoever extracted "September"
 * from a sentence owns that judgment — since 2026-09-26 that is the model, which
 * writes the explicit `eventDate` field on `note` / `session_end` — and the
 * deriver owns only what follows from it.
 *
 * Every refusal has a NAME. "Not prospective" is not a verdict a log can act on,
 * and a memory excluded because it is a skill and one excluded because its window
 * already passed are different systems (scar §2.4).
