/**
 * `prospective/` — remembering to act. Know that the remembered future has
 * arrived, and be *inclined* rather than *reminded*.
 *
 * The module's spine:
 *
 *   `windows.ts`   precision, window bounds, the ramp, the firing KEY
 *   `derive.ts`    the eligibility predicate — derived, never stored
 *   `tunables.ts`  every knob, in one visible place
 *   `index.ts`     arrivals (read) + the firing-state transitions (write)
 *
 * Three properties are structural here and worth stating at the top:
 *
 * **ARRIVAL IS A CUE, NOT A COMMAND. THERE IS NO BYPASS LANE.** The calendar
 * turning to June is treated exactly like the user saying "Portland": one more
 * cue offered into `recall/`'s ordinary activation → gate → tier competition,
 * under the same floors, refractory, dedup and footnote-first tiering as
 * everything else. This module therefore has **no export that produces text** —
 * no render, no injection, no wording, not even a template. It hands out
 * candidates and weights; whether anything is ever said is entirely `recall/`'s
 * decision, made against the same bars as every other memory. A test enumerates
 * this module's exports and asserts the absence (contract §5 G1).
 *
 * **The tact principle IS the spec.** A system that surfaces every stored
 * commitment at first retrievability is a task queue wearing memory's clothes.
 * Hold debts, lose deadlines. Every brake here answers one question: *is this the
 * moment it MEANS something, or merely the first moment it's retrievable?*
 *
 * **Firing state is not canonical memory** (§12 G12). Losing a row risks one
 * extra polite mention, never a memory — so the write budget is small and loud:
 * transitions never stall a host-facing path, and every refusal has a name.
