/**
 * CONTRADICTIONS — the mechanism (2026-09-29). Reconsolidation and
 * interference: two memories that disagree are noticed, settled, and the
 * settlement is kept and can be undone. A file beside `revision.ts`, not a
 * module, for the reason `revision.ts` is one: it is the seam where a memory
 * that argues with another one lands, and every door reaches it. Its docs sit
 * with the revision dispatch (`schemas/CONTRACT.md` §5 and `schemas/NOTES.md`),
 * its table with the store (`contradictions`, `contradiction_settles`, schema
 * v10), its labels with recall (`recall/standing.ts`).
 *
 * **Three kinds, each with its own outcome** (`SETTLE_HOWS`, working
 * defaults from the 2026-09-29 brief, held lightly):
 *
 *   | how         | the memory it is over                                    |
 *   |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
 *   | `changed`   | its fade multiplier x CHANGED_FADE (`changedFade`), stays |
 *   |             | recallable, labelled `earlier`; a use leaves the fade     |
 *   | `corrected` | archived `corrected` — out of recall, readable by its own |
 *   |             | id, never deleted                                         |
 *   | `open`      | nothing moves; both are shown with each other             |
 *
 * **One way to settle, from anywhere.** A new memory settles the one it
 * `updates` as it is written (`settleOnWrite`, called by `revision.ts` in
 * place of the ordinary-memory "link-only" arm); a pair that already exists —
 * a dream's flag, where both memories are old — is settled by `settle`, which
 * the awake `note` tool, the dream's `settle` action, the reflection and the
 * owner's `counterparts settle` all reach. No gate on who: a TRAIL instead
 * (`contradiction_settles`: who, the kind, why, the ids, when), and every
 * settle can be undone (`undo`): the fade divided back out for `changed`, back
 * into recall for `corrected`, and the pair unsettled again when it was a flag
 * — withdrawn when nobody had flagged it (review of #284, S5).
 *
 * **Settling an existing pair rewrites no body.** Appending the journey line
 * to the winner would be a revision (a supersede, a forwarding address), which
 * fights the rule that an old id reads as itself. The record of an existing
 * pair is its trail row's `why` and the link; recall reads the rest off the
 * pair (`recall/standing.ts`). A new memory carries its journey line in its
 * own words, written by the model — the tool descriptions ask for it.
 *
 * **Noticing at write time** (`writeNeighbours`): the nearest few live
 * memories of one just written, above a similarity bar, handed back with the
 * write so the writer can settle there and then. No model call.
 *
 * **A write's word is checked before it settles** (`updateRelatedness`,
 * 2026-10-09). A `changed` or `corrected` declared by id moves the old
 * memory on the writer's word alone, and a weaker writer points at the wrong
 * one: in a 10-02 benchmark read, a Haiku writer named an unrelated memory in
 * about two thirds of 149 pairs (a mole removal retired a passport name
 * change). So the pair is read first — by meaning when the embedder can read
 * both, by shared content words when it cannot — and a pair that looks
 * unrelated is HELD: the new memory lands, the old one is not settled and
 * not linked, the writer is shown the old one's words and asked to settle it
 * itself if it meant to (`HELD_HINT`), and the hold is recorded
 * (`CONTRADICTION_HELD_EVENT`). No pair is written: an unrelated pair shown
 * as a disagreement would be noise. `Counterpart#deposit` decides when the
 * guard applies (a close or a redate goes straight through); this file reads
 * the pair. No model call.
 *
 * Arithmetic and bookkeeping only. Refusals are RETURNED with a reason and a
 * sentence, never thrown; an observer writes nothing and says so.
