/**
 * `Counterpart` — the composition root: one brain over one data dir.
 *
 * Every module below this file is deliberately ignorant of its neighbours, and
 * every seam between them is already closed and proved (`docs/SEAMS.md` items
 * 1–3 and A–N). What was still missing was a place where all of them are
 * assembled ONCE, so an adapter composes a brain instead of re-deriving the
 * wiring — which is how a caller "forgets the map and silently loses the safety
 * half that rides along with it" (recall/INTERFACE-GAPS §2, scar §2.6).
 *
 * **This file is wiring. It states no rule of its own.**
 *
 * That is not a style note, it is a mechanized property: `test/counterpart.test.ts`
 * scans this source with comments and string literals stripped and fails on any
 * numeric literal other than 0 or 1. Every number that governs behaviour —
 * budgets, floors, chunk sizes, candidate limits, retention — arrives as an
 * argument or as an import from the module that owns it. A threshold invented
 * here would be a threshold with no home, no CAL marking and no test
 * (scar §2.8), and a host ceiling invented here would be scar §2.18 exactly.
 *
 * The four things this file DOES decide, all of them structural:
 *
 *   1. **Construction order.** `associate` exists before `schemas`, because
 *      `SchemasOptions.retarget` (SEAMS E) is the callback that keeps a
 *      successor from being born cold.
 *   2. **The gates are always wired.** `bridge.batteryGate()` on the authored
 *      front door, `bridge.episodeGate()` on `self/` (SEAMS H — self's own
 *      default REFUSES, and this is what makes that unreachable in production),
 *      and `bridge.gateSweepChunk()` on the fallback, chunk-level (SEAMS 1).
 *   3. **The channel is engine-set.** `"authored"` for the session-end dump and
 *      the jot; `"fallback"` for anything a transcript sweep produced. No
 *      author field and no interpreter output can move it (SEAMS N).
 *   4. **The host's ceiling travels as an argument.** `wake(budgetBytes)` is
 *      where the host reports it; the same number is what `runCycle` hands the
 *      renderer at the boundary. Absent, the briefing REFUSES to render and says
 *      so — an invented ceiling is the failure scar §2.18 records.

 * had one bucket for everything that was not `NO_CRASHED_SESSION` and a comment
 * claiming a nonzero bucket was a bad day — which the live run disproved by
 * reading 5–7 on every single day: a session stays in the crashed set after it
 * is swept and retired, so its scope answers `NOTHING_TO_SWEEP` forever.
 * `remember/fallback.ts#QUIET_SWEEP_REASONS` is the division that replaces the
 * claim; `noisyRefusals` sums the reasons worth an alarm on the FIRST one

   * the ceiling is delivered — so a reserve sized for fewer than the directory
   * now holds (the one-boundary lag, when a new author appears) shows fewer
   * rather than none. `no-room` is written only when not even the last rung
   * fits. Each handoff shown in full gets its own `handoff.shown` row; the

  /**
   * THE HEBBIAN HALF OF THE CREDIT PASS — buffered here, written down elsewhere.
   *
   * `coactivate()` accumulates pair deltas in an in-process `DeltaBuffer` (the
   * declared durability exemption, `associate/CONTRACT.md` §5 G11) and `flush()`
   * turns them into edge rows. On a host whose every hook is a fresh process
   * those two halves are in different processes: this pass runs inside a Stop
   * hook, and `sessionEnd` runs in the worker that Stop spawns. For the whole
   * of the parallel run the buffer therefore died at hook exit — the owner's
   * store carried 430 edges, every one stamped with the import's lived day,
   * through 214 credit passes (mechanism inventory 2026-09-17 §3 S3).
   *
   * So the pass DRAINS its buffer to a file and the worker applies it
   * (`associate/pending.ts`). It does not flush, and it does not append a
   * durable row. Both were writes, and this path meets the detached worker's
   * own write lock: an adversarial probe measured 5.3 s of blocking apiece
   * under a held lock — I38's exact scenario, `database is locked` in 3 of 8
   * runs — with the drained deltas then recorded nowhere. **No database lock is
   * taken for association on the hook path at all**; the reads `coactivate`
   * makes (the deny-list, the member rows) are reads.
   *
   * CONTAINED, because a hook may not fail its host (adapter CONTRACT §5 G2).
   * `coactivate` reads the graph, and the append is a filesystem write; both are
   * wrapped, so neither can climb into the adapter's outer catch and mark a
   * boundary `failed` whose physics credit had already landed. An append that
   * fails costs the pass's deltas and leaves an in-process event as the only
   * record of it — the one loss this redesign does not close, and it is a disk
   * that refused a kilobyte rather than a lock somebody else was holding.
   *
   * An observer buffers nothing (`associate/` G7) and writes no file: the
   * stand-down returns before the directory is so much as created. It is
   * evented in process, so it stays distinguishable from a hook that broke
   * (observer-mode.md G6, scar §2.4).

  /**
   * THE SELF THE FALLBACK IS WOKEN WITH — composed at most once per sweep, on
   * the first chunk that reaches the interpreter, and written nowhere.
   *
   * Owner ruling 2026-09-17 (`docs/storage-spec-2026-09-16.md` §15 item 3): any
   * background writer of memories gets as much of the self as is reasonable
   * before it reads a transcript, on the same reasoning as the planned sleep-time
   * writer — what makes a model call "me" is the memory it wakes with. The
   * output stays labeled `fallback`, so the ratio of authored to fallback is
   * still visible; this changes the VOICE the fallback writes in, not who gets
   * the credit for it.
   *
   * Three properties are load-bearing, and each is a line here:
   *
   * **NO SIDE EFFECTS.** `self.build()` is the composer's pure half — it reads,
   * ranks and composes, and writes nothing (`self/index.ts#build`). The rotation
   * memory (`self.rendered.<id>`) and the published bundle are written by
   * `boundary()` and by nothing else, so a sweep cannot move the identity lane's
   * turn or change a byte of what the next live session wakes to. A sweep that
   * republished the wake would be the instrument mutating what it measures.
   *
   * **NOTHING CONFIDENTIAL LEAVES** (constitution 6). This composition ends up
   * in a prompt on a socket, so it is not the owner-facing wake: confidential
   * rows (`recall/activate.ts#isConfidential`) and PROTECTED rows are omitted
   * before any lane sees them — protected because `schemas/` already stands them
   * out of the interpreter's cards (§14.1 G2, "permanent ink never enters the
   * falsification path"), and the wake copy is the same falsification path by a
   * second door. The stand-aside is counted, never silent. `redactSecrets` runs
   * over the result too: the same egress rule the chunk vectors and the card
   * text already cross, held here rather than assumed from the encode gate.
   *
   * **NOT THE LIVE SESSION'S WAKE, BYTE FOR BYTE** (2026-09-17 review). Same
   * composer, different bundle, and the differences are all deliberate: no
   * `horizon`, so the prospective lane a live wake carries is simply absent; no
   * protected or confidential MEMORY; and the compose budget is the reported one
   * whole, where a live wake first subtracts `PREFACE_RESERVE_BYTES` for a
   * preface this composition has no use for.
   *
   * **THE SELF PAGE IS THE ONE THING THAT GOES OUT DESPITE BEING PROTECTED**
   * (2026-09-18, S1; corrected here after the adversarial review found this
   * comment claiming otherwise). The page is born `protected`, and the predicate
   * below filters on exactly that — but the flag is the floor prune's vocabulary
   * (`self/page.ts`) rather than a confidentiality class, and this composition is
   * the owner's own decision of 2026-09-17 (spec §15 item 3): the background
   * writer is woken AS the self, with as much of the self as is reasonable,
   * before it reads a transcript, so what it writes is not a stranger's
   * paraphrase. The transcript it is handed on the same call already goes to the
   * same provider. What leaves is the page and nothing else — the owner's and the
   * session's own standing account of the self, cut to the same cap the wake
   * uses. `self/`'s `PAGE_ON_EGRESS` is the switch, default true; turned off,
   * this composition gets no page and its "Who I am" falls back to the identity
   * list the predicate left standing, which is what it carried before S1.
   * Nothing marks a page confidential today: it is one page, and the switch is
   * the decision.
   *
   * **THE CAP IS A COMPOSE BUDGET, not a slice.** It is handed to the composer,
   * so `self/`'s declared trim order does the cutting and the bundle's own
   * header and sentinel still state the truth about it — *truncation must never
   * be iteration luck* (§1 G3). `trimmed > 0` is what the telemetry reports as
   * the cap having bitten.
   *
   * COLD START IS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR EXACTLY: a store with no rendered element —
   * fresh, or one whose whole active set was stood aside — carries no block, and
   * the prompt is byte-for-byte what it was before this existed. So does a host
   * that reported no injection ceiling: it composed no wake for its live sessions
   * either, and inventing a number here would be the default scar §2.18 forbids.

   * ONE `gate.deposit` ROW PER DEPOSIT THAT REACHED THE BATTERY — the authored
   * door's half of the gate log (replay INTERFACE-GAPS §2a).
   *
   * WHEN NOTHING IS WRITTEN, and why that is the honest answer rather than a
   * hole: `records` is empty exactly when no battery ran. An observer stood
   * down, intake found the draft malformed, the content was already deposited,
   * or the gate itself threw — all four are decided before or instead of the
   * battery (`remember/` NOTES §7's rejection ordering), and a row claiming five
   * clear gates for a draft no gate ever saw would be worse than no row (scar
   * §2.4). Those outcomes keep the in-process `counterpart.deposit.refused`
   * event they have always had.
   *
   * **NO `dedupKey`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE FROM `gate.chunk`.**
   * `store.pruneEvents` exempts a latched row by construction — a latch is the
   * replay anti-double-append, so sweeping one would let a replayed day re-record
   * what the store already accounted for. That price is right for `gate.chunk`,
   * whose writer is the crash fallback and whose ordinary rate is zero rows a
   * day. It is wrong here: the authored door fires at every session end and
   * every jot, so a latch would put a permanently un-sweepable row on the
   * busiest write path in the system. Unlatched, this row is the same class as
   * `recall.decision`, which made exactly this call for exactly this reason
   * (replay INTERFACE-GAPS §7, "no retention rule was added").
   *
   * **AND THE HONEST HALF, NOW CLOSED: the events table IS swept.** When this
   * row was added, `Store.pruneEvents()` existed, was tested, and had NO caller
   * anywhere in `src/` — "unlatched" bought eligibility, not deletion (filed as
   * `src/core/sleep/NOTES.md` §13). Since 2026-09-05 sleep's `log` phase calls
   * it as the cycle's last step: this row leaves the log once it is older than
   * the store's window (90 lived days by default), at most `BUDGETS.log` rows a
   * pass (`sleep/CONTRACT.md` §5 G16, `sleep/NOTES.md` §15).
   *
   * What the latch would have bought is bought elsewhere anyway: an accepted
   * deposit cannot repeat, because `remember/`'s content ledger refuses a second
   * deposit of the same text in the same scope before the battery is called. A
   * refused one CAN repeat, and two refusals are honestly two events.
