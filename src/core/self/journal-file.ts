/**
 * THE JOURNAL'S MARKDOWN COPY — the one file the owner can open in any editor.
 *
 * Constitution line 6 promises "memories kept as prose the owner can view".
 * Since the floor (schema v6) every body is a column, so that promise is kept
 * in two named places and nowhere else: `counterparts export --markdown`, and
 * this — a `.md` per episode under `<store>/journal/`, written as each chapter
 * lands. It is here rather than in an adapter because the owner ruled it so
 * (decision 2, 2026-09-17 §15 item 9: "the self is being recovered from v1
 * right now because its pages and journal were plain files that outlived their
 * system").
 *
 * **BY OWNER DECISION 2 THIS IS THE ONE `self/` MODULE THAT TREATS `Store.dir`
 * AS A FILESYSTEM ROOT.** Said at the top rather than left for a reviewer to
 * find. `remember/spans.ts` is the precedent: a core module that owns one
 * directory inside the store and nothing else.
 *
 * Four properties, and each one is a decision somebody can reverse:
 *
 *   - **DERIVED AND WRITE-ONLY.** The row is the truth. Nothing in this
 *     codebase ever reads a journal file back into the store — there is no
 *     parser here, on purpose, and `render.ts` says the same from its side.
 *     Deleting `journal/` loses nothing: the next chapter, or the background
 *     worker's next backfill pass, writes it again.
 *   - **WRITTEN AS IS** (owner ruling 2, 2026-09-18). No summary, no
 *     re-rendering of the words, no second renderer: `render.ts#renderMarkdown`
 *     is what export writes and it is what this writes, byte for byte. The
 *     front matter identifies the episode — id, session, dates, chapter count —
 *     and carries nothing the row does not hold. Credentials were redacted at
 *     the gate before the row was written (`self/index.ts#appendChapter`); this
 *     copies the row and cannot un-redact anything.
 *   - **IT NEVER FAILS A SESSION.** Nothing here throws. A copy that cannot be
 *     written is a `journal.copy.failed` row with a reason code; the chapter is
 *     already committed and is not at risk. A `chapter` call, a Stop hook and a
 *     boundary must not be able to fail because a disk was full.
 *   - **THE REMOVAL CHASE REACHES IT.** A file holding a removed memory's words
 *     while the console prints `unchased: nothing` is the finding F5's reviews
 *     raised twice (B MAJOR-1, C NEW-MAJOR-1) and the span buffer's scar before
 *     that. `syncJournalCopy` is the executable form of the invariant: a live
 *     episode row gets a file that matches it, and anything else gets no file.
 *     The owner's destruction console calls it as a named surface. (Named
 *     obliquely on purpose: a test greps every file under `src/` for that
 *     module's own filename and fails on a mention, which is how the
 *     one-importer rule is kept honest.)

/**
 * The durable row for one copy — `journal.copy.written` or `.failed`.
 *
 * Content-by-reference (§5 G10): the episode id, the store-relative file, a
 * byte count, a chapter count, a reason CODE. Never a word of the chapter. The
 * `date` field is what `adapters/fired.ts` reads to say when this mechanism
 * last fired, so it rides on every row.
 *
 * It never throws either: an observer's store refuses every write by name, and
 * a copy that could not be recorded is still a copy.
 *
 * **A FAILURE IS DEDUPED, per (episode, reason, day); a directory-level failure
 * is deduped per (reason, day) and names no episode** (review f6f7 MAJOR-2,
 * measured at 80 rows for one broken directory across five chapters and three
 * worker cycles). The latch is the store's own `dedupKey`, so the second row of
 * the same fact is refused inside the same transaction that would have written
 * it rather than by a read this function would have to get right.
 *
 * THE DAY IN THE KEY IS THE CALENDAR DATE, not the lived day, and that is a
 * deliberate divergence from the ask's wording: it is the same `date` the
 * payload carries and `doctor` prints, so the key and the row cannot disagree
 * about what a day is. The lived clock advances only inside the worker's own
 * cycle (`episodes.ts#asksSpentOn`, scar I32), so keying on it would make a
 * store whose worker has not run for a week dedup a week of failures into one.
 *
 * The cost, said out loud: dedup-keyed rows are never swept by `pruneEvents` —
 * they are the replay latch. One row per episode per reason per day is a bounded
 * price for a log that can be read; a permanently broken directory leaves one
 * row a day, for ever, and that is the point rather than an oversight.
 *
 * SUCCESSES ARE NOT DEDUPED. "The copy was written" is what the fired view
 * counts, and a mechanism that recorded one firing a day would under-report the
 * thing the owner is watching for.
