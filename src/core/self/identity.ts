 *     it was ever shown — not since its last use of any kind. A use while it
 *     was showing is exactly the use the display may have prompted, so it
 *     keeps the memory's own strength up (it credits, as always) but buys it
 *     no advantage here, and it is not a return (physics §5.11).
 *   - **HABITUATION.** Each published showing adds `HINT_STEP` to a load that
 *     recovers as `exp(-days / HINT_RECOVERY_DAYS)` once it stops showing; the
 *     pull left is `1 / (1 + HINT_HABITUATION x load)`. Used or not while it
 *     was shown, the step is the same. A return AFTER it left the wake — the
 *     memory reached for without the prompt — resets the load outright.
 *
 * The score is `organic x habituation`; the warm floor still reads the
 * memory's own strength. Pure: the caller hands in the display row.

 * the same reminder printed under "Arriving:" and "Nearby", both with its due
 * date (random-f2's item 13). The horizon is the more specific of the two — it
 * says when — so a memory arriving leaves craft, threads and hints; identity
 * still wins, and a memory there leaves the horizon instead.
 *

 * craft, threads, hints or the horizon: shown alone, an answered question reads
 * as still open (random-f2's item 11). Identity keeps it — that band is earned.
 * It stays in recall, labelled by its standing.

 * `schemas/` refuses to birth `kind: "self"` in two independent layers — "one
 * identity core; a second is a category error no evidence could justify" — so the
 * one row that says *the self exists as an entity here* can only come from this
 * module. Without it, `schemas/`'s placement rule degrades from
 * `status-on-identity-refused` to `entity-unknown`: still a refusal, but the
 * wrong one, and a silent weakening of the ~72 KB lesson (contract §5 G4) exactly
 * where it matters most.
 *
 * What this is NOT: v1's identity *index* — its own budget, warmth ordering,
 * promotion path and reconciler — which the contract drops and this build does
 * not have. Identity STATEMENTS remain ordinary memories ranked by strength; this
 * is one empty schema row carrying names, which is what "a newborn schema is
 * empty except its names" means.
