/**
 * `self/` — the autobiographical self: identity elements, the first-person
 * episode journal, and the wake briefing that restores a continuous self at
 * session start.
 *
 * The module's spine, and where each piece lives:
 *
 *   `identity.ts`  ranking by strength, the identity/protected enumeration, the
 *                  standing self-schema byte counter
 *   `briefing.ts`  the composed budget, the declared trim order, the header and
 *                  tail sentinel — no model, no network, no prompt
 *   `freeze.ts`    freeze-but-keep-counting: the lived-salience doctrine as a
 *                  pure verdict both arms compute
 *   `episodes.ts`  substance-paced chapters, live append, add-first ingestion
 *   `tunables.ts`  every knob, in one visible place — and NOT the byte budget
 *
 * Three properties are structural here and worth stating at the top.
 *
 * **RENDER and WAKE are different halves of different sessions.** `boundary()`
 * composes and publishes; `wake()` reads what was published and verifies it. The
 * briefing is the previous boundary's last content write, and wake performs no
 * computation, no model call, and no network access — nor any WRITE, which is the
 * part v1's own design left implicit and then leaned on.
 *
 * **The budget is the caller's.** `budgetBytes` is required on the request
 * because the injection ceiling is a host capability the adapter reports (scar
 * §2.18). v1's 9,000 was 90% of one host's cliff and there is deliberately no
 * such constant in this module.
 *
 * **The freeze withholds movement, never measurement.** `noteSelfConfirmation`
 * runs one walk with one set of guards and emits one event name; `frozen` is a
 * field on that event, not a different code path, so the frozen rate and the live
 * rate share a denominator (§14.2 G4).
 *
 * There is **no tool surface in this module**. v1's self-store tool is superseded
 * by experiencer authorship (contract §4): the doctrine that identity strength
 * comes from lived salience is kept whole, and the end-of-session write *is* the
 * front door it names. Authorship arrives through `remember/`; `self/` is where
 * it lands. *If a doctrine names the only legitimate inputs, those inputs must be
 * reachable by construction, not by a tool description nobody reads.*

   * **How "no page" is represented, and why.** ONE ROW FOR THE LIFE OF THE PAGE:
   * the clear is an ordinary REVISION — so the body it replaces becomes an
   * ordinary version, attributed like every other — to a fixed cleared-body line,
   * with `meta.cleared` set. The row stays live and keeps its whole version
   * chain. `readSelfPage` returns null for a cleared row, so every reader — the
   * wake, the doctor, the dashboard, the MCP read, the console — sees a store
   * with no page and the wake goes back to its empty-page behaviour exactly as
   * if none had ever been written. The next write or restore revises the SAME
   * row and drops the flag.
   *
   * The first design archived the row instead, and the second review proved what
   * that cost: `revisePage` finds live rows, so the next write — including the
   * `--restore <seq>` the clear message itself recommends — minted a fresh row
   * and orphaned four versions with full attribution on a row no surface could
   * reach. The undo mechanism closed behind the owner as he walked through it.
   * Deleting was never available (not a verb `store/` has, on purpose), and
   * blanking the body would leave a live page whose text is a placeholder, which
   * is the "empty is a valid state" failure the bootstrap line exists to avoid
   * (§1 G5): a page that says nothing and a store with no page must not render
   * the same. The flag is what tells those two apart.
   *
   * It is the owner's door alone: no MCP tool reaches it. A session that could
