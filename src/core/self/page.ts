/**
 * THE SELF PAGE — one written page, the same every morning, kept in the store
 * with its versions.
 *
 * Until now "Who I am:" was a rotating list of about twenty identity elements,
 * re-ranked at every boundary, and the entity the store calls the self was a row
 * whose body was its own name. A list that changes every morning is not a self;
 * it is a query result. The owner's ruling of 2026-09-18 (plan §2 item 9): at
 * wake the self is a page of prose, written in the first person, that any woken
 * session may amend and the owner may write by hand, and that says out loud when
 * there is nothing there yet. Promotion and reinforcement still decide what
 * feeds it — they are untouched by this file; the page is where the growth
 * shows.
 *
 * **One row, through the ordinary Store API.** `put` mints it, `revise` changes
 * it (archiving the prior version first, §16 G4), `versions`/`readVersion` read
 * what it used to say. Nothing here knows whether a body is a file or a column,
 * so the floor can move underneath it (plan §3, F5) without this module noticing.
 *
 * **Where it sits, and why it survives sleep.** `type: "schema"`, `kind: "self"`,
 * `meta.role = "page"` — the same shelf the identity core sits on, one role
 * along. That placement is what keeps the sleep cycle off it, using only
 * mechanisms that already existed:
 *
 *   - `dedup` skips every schema row by name (`sleep/types.ts#isSchemaRow`), so
 *     the page is never merged into something that resembles it;
 *   - `prune` is blocked by `protected` (`physics#pruneVerdict`), which the row
 *     is born with — the page is the owner's and the self's standing ink, and
 *     the prune's own vocabulary already has a word for that;
 *   - `decay` and `consolidate` write physics columns and never prose, so the
 *     worst they can do is move a number on a row nothing ranks;
 *   - `scanActive` lists `{ type: "memory" }`, so the page can never enter a
 *     briefing lane as an element and be trimmed as one.
 *
 * Old VERSIONS of the page take the ordinary retention (owner ruling 1, 2026-09-18):
 * `pruneSupersededVersions` deletes by `version_day` alone and has no exemption
 * to make one for, which is the behaviour that ruling asked for.
 *
 * **The role is invisible to `schemas/`** — `toMetaRecord` returns null for any
 * role but entity, belief and current-state, so the page is skipped by the
 * index build rather than mis-filed in it.
