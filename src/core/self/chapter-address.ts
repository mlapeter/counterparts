/**
 * CHAPTER ADDRESSES (v12, 2026-10-03, the write side of deliberate recall) —
 * one chapter of an episode, named `epi_…#N` (N counted from 1), resolved to
 * its heading, its text, its span in time, and the memories its session
 * wrote during that span.
 *
 * **Derived, not stored.** The address is the episode's id and the chapter's
 * place among the engine headings in its body (`handoff/last-here.ts#
 * chaptersOf`, the one reader of them); nothing records it. What IS stored is
 * the moment each chapter was written (`episodes.ts#CHAPTER_AT_META`, from
 * v12 on), because the only other record of it — the version row each new
 * chapter leaves behind (`reason: episode-chapter`, its `archived_at` the
 * moment the next chapter opened) — is pruned after the retention window. An
 * episode written before v12 is read from those versions while they last;
 * past them, a chapter's moment is unknown and the resolver says so rather
 * than guessing one from the heading's calendar day.
 *
 * **A chapter's span** is the stretch it wrote up: from the moment the
 * chapter before it was written (none for the first: open) to the moment it
 * was written. The memories under it are its session's own (`origin_session`),
 * live, minus the chapter copies themselves, written inside that span — with
 * `CHAPTER_MOMENT_GRACE_MS` after each edge, because the end-of-stretch answer
 * writes its memories and its chapter in one turn, in either order, and the
 * memories written a moment after the chapter belong to it rather than to the
 * next. A write-up's memories (another session writing this one's stretch
 * up later) carry this session's id but a later moment, so they fall after
 * the last chapter and are not listed under any.
 *
 * No caller in recall yet (Release B); the tests prove it resolves.
