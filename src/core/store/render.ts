/**
 * Markdown, one direction only — the EXPORT format.
 *
 * This was `prose.ts#serializeProse`, one half of a round trip: the store wrote
 * a file and parsed it back, and the frontmatter's `payload:` line existed so
 * that a lossy YAML reading could never become the truth. Since the floor
 * (schema v6) the row is the truth and **nothing parses this back**. It is what
 * `counterparts export --markdown` writes, and what the journal's file copy
 * writes (F6/F7) — a copy for the owner and for whatever outlives this program,
 * which is exactly the argument that earned the journal its files
 * (owner, 2026-09-17 §15 item 9: "the self is being recovered from v1 right now
 * because its pages and journal were plain files that outlived their system").
 *
 * The shape is kept byte-for-byte rather than simplified, on purpose. Every
 * `.md` the owner's v2 store ever wrote is in this format, the `payload:` line
 * is what makes such a file re-readable by a future importer without guessing,
 * and G8's omitted-when-absent (a field never used emits no line at all) is a
 * property of the format, not of the writer that is gone.
