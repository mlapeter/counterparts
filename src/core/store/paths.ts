 * before, ON wherever this repo's own tooling runs — `test/preload.ts`, the demo
 * seeder, the visual loop, the recall bench, and the agent shells the owner
 * ruled it into. The install loop deliberately UNSETS it inside its clean room

 *
 * `adapters/config-path.ts#implicitConfigRefusal` is the same guard at the other
 * door: a default-sourced `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` NAMES a store, so the
