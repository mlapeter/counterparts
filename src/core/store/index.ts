/**
 * The store seam.
 *
 * TWO boxes behind one object, since the floor (schema v6, 2026-09-20):
 *   2. canonical      — `counterparts.sqlite`   (box 2, `operational.ts`)
 *   3. rebuildable    — `cache/cache.sqlite`    (box 3, `cache.ts`)
 *
 * Box 1 — `prose/**.md`, one markdown file per memory — is gone. `memories`
 * carries `title`, `body` and `meta`, and `versions` carries its own copy of the
 * three, so a memory and its history are one row and one transaction. Markdown
 * is an EXPORT (`render.ts`), and `ProseDoc` is still the read shape, which is
 * why `physics/`, `recall/`, `associate/`, `prospective/`, `encode/` and most of
 * `sleep/` never learned the floor moved.
 *
 * What that buys, in the words of the scars it closes: a crash can no longer
 * leave a row whose words are missing (there is no window between "commit the
 * row" and "publish the file"), removing a memory is one transaction rather than
 * a file chase, a backup is one file, and a copied store cannot read or delete
 * the source store's words because there are none outside the database (I22,
 * whose mechanism is deleted and whose criterion is kept).
 *
 * Every write crosses `mutate()`: it checks the observer stance FIRST, then opens a
 * transaction on box 2. That ordering is the point — an instrument refuses before it
 * has staged a byte, and a future caller inherits the refusal instead of having to
 * remember it (observer-mode.md G3, contract §5 G1).
 *
 * There is no delete/remove/unlink/rm export or method anywhere in this module, for
 * prose or anything else. Removal is an owner operation on a structurally distinct
 * path — see `owner-op-seam.ts`; the store's half of it is the append-only removal
 * record plus the deny-list consulted at load and rebuild (§16 G1, G7, G12).
 *
 * The deny-list is consulted HERE, at the seam, so every module inherits the
 * refusal instead of having to remember it: `read`/`readProse`/`physicsOf`/
 * `readVersion` raise a named `REMOVED` rather than an ENOENT on a chased file,
 * `resolve` stops at a removed id instead of dangling past it, and `put` refuses
 * to reuse one. `row()` is the deliberate exception — it is the raw box-2
 * accessor, and an instrument reading the skeleton of a removed memory is how the
 * owner sees that something WAS here (constitution 16).

/**
 * THE TWO ROWS THAT NEVER GET A VECTOR, and why the rule is one function.
 *
 * Both are `type: "schema"` rows that are DELIVERED AT THE WAKE and are skipped
 * by `recall/activate.ts`, so neither can reach a turn through the semantic
 * channel however good its vector is. Embedding either buys retrieval nothing
 * and costs three things that were measured rather than argued:
 *
 *   1. **The most sensitive prose in the store goes out to an embedding API for
 *      no use.** The self page is up to 6 KB of first-person identity (16 KB
 *      if written before 2026-10-09); the
 *      handoff is the prose E1's own CONTRACT calls the likeliest to carry a
 *      token. Data leaves the machine only by the owner's choice (constitution
 *      6), and "because the indexer indexes everything" is not a choice.
 *   2. **They put a permanent floor under `unembeddedCount()`** — the number
 *      `doctor` and the parallel run watch, whose whole job is to say what is
 *      ACTIONABLE. On a keyless store that floor never falls.
 *   3. **A vector for a superseded body can displace a live neighbour** on the
 *      semantic slate (`cache.ts#deindexDoc`'s note: `nearestTo` scans
 *      `embeddings` with no liveness filter). Fewer rows in that table that
 *      nothing can deliver is strictly better.
 *
 *   - **`role: "page"`** — the self page (S1). Raised by E1's adversarial review
 *     as "worth checking whether the page is in the same position"; it was, and
 *     the coordinating session asked for the exclusion on 2026-09-20. **A
 *     WORKING DEFAULT, not a ruling — the owner has not been asked, and this is
 *     revisable without ceremony** (CLAUDE.md). The three reasons above are the
 *     whole of the argument for it; if any of them stops being true, so does
 *     this line.
 *   - **`role: "handoff"`** — the per-directory handoff (E1).
 *
 * Read STRUCTURALLY, for the reason `recall/` reads these roles structurally:
 * `store/` depends on no module above it, and a parse that fails reads as
 * "embed it", which is the direction that only ever costs a vector nobody asks
 * for. The strings' owners are `core/self/page.ts#SELF_PAGE_ROLE` and
 * `core/handoff/index.ts#HANDOFF_ROLE`.
 *
 * **What is NOT excluded, checked by the same test and left alone:**
 * the JOURNAL (`type: "episode"`) is a real recall candidate — `activate` does
 * not skip it, `expandHandle` returns it with `journal: true`, and the backfill
 * puts episodes in the FIRST group on purpose — so a vector buys it something
 * and it keeps one. Beliefs and entities (`role: "belief"`, `"entity"`) are
 * candidates too. S2's nightly writer mints no row of its own: it revises the
 * PAGE row and writes events, so excluding the page covers it whole.
