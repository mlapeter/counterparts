/**
 * The document shape a memory is READ as, and the two guards that keep it
 * honest on the way into a row.
 *
 * Until the floor (schema v6) this file was box 1: a markdown parser, a stager,
 * an archiver, and ~16,000 files under `prose/`. The memory is now the ROW —
 * `memories.title`, `.body`, `.meta` — so the parser has nothing to parse and
 * the stager nothing to stage. `ProseDoc` survives unchanged as the read shape,
 * which is the seam that let the whole brain layer above `store/` not notice
 * the floor move; `render.ts` keeps the markdown, one direction only, as the
 * EXPORT format. Nothing reads it back.
 *
 * What is left here is what the row still needs:
 *
 *   - `ProseDoc` / `ProseType` / `ID_PREFIX` — the shape and the id families;
 *   - `hashText` — the one content-address function (contract §3);
 *   - `assertJsonSafe` — the G6 guard, now over the `meta` COLUMN. A function,
 *     an `undefined`, a symbol or a `NaN` in meta is silent data loss whether
 *     it is dropped on the way into a file or on the way into a TEXT column,
 *     and v1's named incident (a parser silently dropping tier, frequency,
 *     provenance and aliases on rewrite) is the reason it is checked at all.

/**
 * The body as it will be STORED, and the rule for whether it may be stored at

 * come to disagree about what an empty memory is.
 *
 * **It NORMALISES rather than refusing** (review B, MINOR-4). A lone surrogate —
 * `"lead \uD800 alone"` — round-trips through SQLite as U+FFFD, so the
 * `content_hash` computed in memory from the original string stopped addressing
 * the row's own body: the one input that broke the invariant the whole floor
 * leans on, and the one the kill test asserts. Refusing was the other option and
 * is the wrong one here: the crash-fallback sweep TRUNCATES transcript text to a
 * budget and can cut a surrogate pair in half, so a refusal would silently drop
 * that memory rather than store it slightly changed. Normalising keeps the
 * memory and keeps `hashText(stored) === row.content_hash` total.
 *
 * **Whitespace-only is empty** (review B, MINOR-5). `put("")` was refused and
 * `put(" ")` was not, so a memory whose body is one space could land and render
 * as an empty memory everywhere — the exact thing closing `revise("")` was for.
 * The MCP `note` door already refused whitespace-only at its own door; this
 * makes the rule the same at every door. A NUL-only body goes the same way.
