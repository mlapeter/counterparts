/**
 * The copy taken before a schema migration changes box 2.
 *
 * `openOperational` calls `snapshotBeforeMigration` inside the migrating
 * transaction, after it has taken the write lock and re-read the version — so
 * of several processes opening an old store at once, only the one that wins the
 * lock copies and migrates; the rest find it current and do neither.
 *
 * The copy is the database only, through `VACUUM INTO` on its own connection
 * (a read, so it sees the last committed state: the store before the
 * migration). The migration changes nothing else in the store, so nothing else
 * needs rolling back. It lands in the same snapshots directory the daily copies
 * use, named `<instant>-pre-migration-v<from>-to-v<to>`, and the daily rotation
 * keeps it apart from its own count (`adapters/snapshots.ts`).
 *
 * If the copy cannot be made, the caller does not migrate.
