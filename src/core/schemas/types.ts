 *
 *   - `entity`        the organizing unit — a person, a place, a skill, a
 *                     project/system, the self. Born by mention, dies by decay.
 *   - `belief`        a statement held about an entity. Revised only by physics
 *                     §5.6 arithmetic; there is no edit verb (CONTRACT §5 G1).
 *   - `current-state` timestamped status about an entity. Refused on the
 *                     identity schema — the ~72 KB lesson (CONTRACT §3).
 *
 * Every row's `kind` is the ENTITY's kind, fixed at birth and never re-derived,
 * so a belief about a person moves at person inertia (iota 0.8) and project
 * status on an entity moves at entity inertia (0.5) — "a loosening chosen out
 * loud" (§4.3).
