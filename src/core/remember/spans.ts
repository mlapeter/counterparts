/**
 * The span buffer — durable holding for lived experience, written at microsecond
 * speed so no host ever waits on judgment (contract §5 G1).
 *
 * Everything durable lives under `<dataDir>/spans/`, one directory per scope:
 *
 *   spans/
 *     scopes.json                the key -> scope legend (keys are hashes, see NOTES §2)
 *     cursors/<scope>.<session>.json  ONE file per (scope, session) — disjoint by
 *                                construction, and scoped so one session id under
 *                                two scopes cannot starve either (PR-1 review)
 *     <key>/buffer.jsonl         the live conversational buffer (append-only)
 *     <key>/assistant.jsonl      the assistant's own turns, kept separately
 *     <key>/boundaries.jsonl     every session-ending boundary, and its ask
 *     <key>/coverage.jsonl       spanHash -> proposalId (the engine's claims)
 *     <key>/proposals.jsonl      minted proposals (also the content-idempotency ledger)
 *     <key>/consumed.jsonl       bounded hash ledger — dedup layer 2 after a claim dies
 *     <key>/failures.jsonl       bounded {hash, at, code} ledger — the retry bound
 *     <key>/quarantine.jsonl     spans that failed MAX_SPAN_FAILURES times, in full
 *     <key>/writeups.jsonl       sessions written up AFTER they ended — {session, at, by}
 *     <key>/strikes.jsonl        what the strike and retention destroyed — counts only
 *     <key>/claims/<id>.jsonl    a claim, renamed ASIDE from the buffer
 *
 * Four structural properties, each load-bearing (contract §5 G3):
 *
 *   advance-after-success   the cursor moves only after the append landed;
 *   two dedup layers        a per-session cursor for a GROWING transcript, a content
 *                           hash for exact repeats — neither catches the other's case;
 *   rename choreography     a claim is `rename(2)`d aside, so a concurrent append
 *                           lands in a fresh buffer and cannot be destroyed;
 *   restore-before-consume  a failed restore keeps the claim, so a failed arc is
 *                           never in neither place.
 *
 * Nothing here calls a model, and nothing here throws into the host (G2): every
 * public capture path is synchronous, wrapped, and returns a REASON.
