   *  holding the pen, then resumed and authored 20 more notes. A 60-minute
   *  window would have swept that gap as a crash and produced twins for exactly
   *  the idle-then-resume shape this owner has. **12 hours** clears that
   *  measured gap with room, and still recovers a real crash the same day the
   *  next worker runs.
