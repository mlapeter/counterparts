/**
 * `remember/` — the authorship pipeline's mechanics.
 *
 * The experiencer writes its own memories at session end, jots in the moment where
 * the host allows, and a transcript sweep exists only as the crash fallback
 * (CONTRACT.md §1). This module owns the *mechanics* of that: durable span capture,
 * proposal intake, coverage by hash, `updates:` resolution, and the fallback's
 * claim/consume choreography.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT own:
 *   - the gate battery (`encode/`) — injected as a `GateFn`;
 *   - the model call (an adapter) — injected as an `InterpretFn`;
 *   - who the `updates:` candidates are (`store/`, `schemas/`) — injected as a
 *     `CandidateSource` plus an `IdResolver`;
 *   - the salience clamp (`physics/`), which governs every memory, not just these.
 *
 * Every one of those seams, and every place another module must meet this one, is
 * listed in INTERFACE-GAPS.md. Implementation choices the CONTRACT left open are in
 * NOTES.md.
