/**
 * Reference resolution (CONTRACT §9.2) — which memories a session's replies
 * actually USED, decided from the assistant's own turns and nothing else.
 *
 * This is the consumer INTERFACE-GAPS §5 said had no home: `resolveUse` routes
 * a DECIDED tier to physics, and until this module nothing decided one. The
 * live consequence, measured 2026-09-14 on the owner's store: every memory
 * minted since launch sat at `uses = 0`, `reinforced_days = 0`, so nothing new
 * could ever cross into the semantic or identity bands (IMPROVEMENTS U10).
 *
 * THE RULE (owner ruling 2026-09-14): a memory is credited when the assistant
 * EXPANDED it through deliberate recall, or QUOTED it at content level. Never
 * for being named in prose, never for being surfaced, never for being rendered
 * in a wake. Reinforcement is for thinking with a memory, not for having been
 * shown it.
 *
 * Two doors, and what each one can see:
 *
 *   **Expanded.** The assistant called the recall tool with `ids` or a
 *   `handle`. The call is an assistant turn; its `input` is the evidence. Ids
 *   are taken from the tool call's input ONLY — never parsed out of prose. The
 *   fixture: on 2026-09-14 the model wrote five `[mem_…]` ids into a reply
 *   having read none of them (IMPROVEMENTS U5). A `handle` that is not itself a
 *   memory id is counted `unresolvedHandles` and credits nothing here: this
 *   module resolves nothing fuzzily, and the tool's own answer was already
 *   exact or not-found.
 *
 *   **Quoted.** A run of `QUOTE_WINDOW_WORDS` consecutive words of a memory's
 *   body appears verbatim (normalized) in an assistant `conversation` turn.
 *   Only a memory that surfaced LOUD is a candidate: a footnoted memory showed
 *   the model nothing but an 80-byte title, so any quote of it is naming, and a
 *   memory the model expanded is credited by the expansion. Paraphrase misses.
 *   That is the contract's bar — precision over recall: a false "used" pollutes
 *   learning permanently, a miss merely leaves weak credit — and the reason
 *   bansai's IDF token overlap (`consolidate/thread-match.ts`) was NOT ported:
 *   an overlap score credits co-mention, a verbatim window credits use.
 *
 * What this module never does: read the store (bodies arrive on the input),
 * call a model, read a file, or judge agreement. A memory the assistant
 * expanded and then argued with is credited — contradiction is engagement,
 * and physics §5.5 counts distinct days, not endorsement.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: the boundary hook runs under a latency budget, so the
 * caller passes a `deadline` and the resolver stops between candidates rather
 * than truncating silently — an overrun is REPORTED (`budgetExceeded`), and
 * what was decided before it stands.
