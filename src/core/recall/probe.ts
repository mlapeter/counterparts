/**
 * THE OQ4 PROBE — is the "quietly available / ignorable" framing actually
 * ignorable to a model? (CONTRACT §7, open question 4; v1 shipped the phrasing
 * as a deliberate probe and never measured it.)
 *
 * The measurement, from rows the store already keeps and nothing else:
 *
 *   `recall.decision`  — per turn, the footnote ids DELIVERED (`footnotes[].id`)
 *   `recall.credit`    — per session-ending boundary, the ids the assistant
 *                        EXPANDED through deliberate recall (`expandedIds`)
 *
 * For each session: footnotes delivered (distinct ids), and how many of those
 * the assistant expanded IN THE SAME SESSION — the one behaviour the header is
 * meant to invite or not. "Same session", not "later": the rows carry no turn
 * order across the two names, so an id expanded on turn 2 and footnoted on
 * turn 9 counts; the bias is the same on both sides of the before/after.
 * Aggregated by calendar date so a change to the header (one string,
 * `render.ts#FRAMING.footnoteHeader`) reads as a before/after on the same
 * table. No model, no prose, no ranking; ids and counts only.
 *
 * A day is MEASURED only when at least one `recall.credit` row exists for it.
 * `expandedIds` reached the credit row with the credit seam (2026-09-14); a
 * day with decision rows and no credit rows prints "-", not 0.000 — nothing
 * recorded what was expanded, so nothing is known. Zero and unknown never
 * share a glyph.
 *
 * THE HIT RATE (2026-10-09) rides the same rows: a `recall.credit` row now
 * scores the ambient showings since the session's last boundary that judged —
 * loud, footnoted and pointer, and how many of each no reply expanded or
 * quoted (`shownNotUsed` holds their ids; `probeMemoryHits`, below, reads them per
 * memory and per lane, 2026-10-10). The probe sums the lanes over the rows that carry the counts. Rows from before
 * carry none and are left out, so the line says how many boundaries it rests on.
 *
 * What this does NOT claim: causation. A session that expanded nothing may
 * have had nothing worth expanding. The probe answers "did the behaviour move
 * when the string moved", which is the question OQ4 asks, and leaves the
 * ruling to the owner.
 */

/**
 * Rows a console fetches per event name. The store's `eventLog` defaults to
 * 500, oldest first, which would silently drop the NEWEST rows — the step-1
 * side of the table — once the log grows past it (review of #104, H1). The
 * dashboard reads under the same ceiling.

 * Pure, over the same rows `probeOQ4` takes. Nothing reads it to act.
 *
 * Decided by b2+f8 (Mike asked 2026-10-10), lightly held: ignoring is measured
 * first and has no effect on strength; if anything acts on it later it lowers
 * how readily a memory surfaces (habituation), not its strength. Decide after
 * the ~10-14 check-in.
 *
 * The unit is a memory in a session. `recall.decision` rows say what was shown
 * and through which lane (`surfaced` is loud; a footnote with `via: "link"` is
 * a quiet pointer); the lane kept is the last showing's, as the gate state the
 * credit pass scores keeps it. The session's `recall.credit` rows say which of
 * those no reply expanded or quoted (`shownNotUsed`). Listed on any of the
 * session's boundaries is ignored in that session, even when a later reply
 * opened it: the score is of the reply it was shown for.
 *
 * A session counts only when one of its credit rows carries the list and none
 * cut it short (`shownNotUsedTotal` above the list's length). Leaving a session
 * out says unknown; counting it would turn an unnamed miss into a hit.
 *
 * The same holds inside a counted session (review of #373): a boundary scores
 * the showings up to its `judgedThrough`, and one that read no reply does not
 * move it. A showing whose turn is past the session's highest `judgedThrough`
 * (the reply not read yet, the session still open, a host that closed without
 * a boundary) was never scored, so it is left out and counted
 * (`unjudgedShowings`); a session none of whose showings were scored is
 * unscored. Not caught: a showing the gate state lost before a boundary
 * scored it (its record cap, a reset) reads as a hit.
