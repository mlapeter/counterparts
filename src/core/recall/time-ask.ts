/**
 * THE TIME A FACTS QUESTION NAMES (2026-10-03, Release B of deliberate recall)
 * — a sibling of `recency-ask.ts`, read by `mcp/facts.ts` only.
 *
 * Facts mode treats time in a question as a FILTER: only memories inside the
 * window come back, with a count of the matches outside it. This file reads
 * the window off the question, says how far it stretches, and hands back the
 * question with the time words taken out — the rest is what the words and the
 * meaning search, or "last week" would match every memory that says "week".
 *
 * What it reads (a working default, held lightly; the revisit may widen it):
 *
 *   - **days**: "today", "yesterday", "this morning", a clock time
 *     (`recency-ask.ts`'s reading, reused), "N days ago" (and "3-4 days ago",
 *     "3 or 4 days ago": both ends; review of #345), "a few days ago",
 *     "the other day", "past N days", "recently", "last Saturday" (and "this
 *     past Saturday": the most recent Saturday BEFORE today, so asked on a
 *     Saturday it is a week ago; 2026-10-09). "This Saturday" and "on
 *     Saturday" are not read: either can be the coming one;
 *   - **weeks**: "last week" (Monday to Sunday), "this week", "N weeks ago"
 *     (and "2-3 weeks ago": both weeks), "the past week";
 *   - **months**: "last month", "this month", "in September", "early / mid /
 *     late October", "the end of August";
 *   - **dates**: `2026-09-21`, `2026-09`, `09-21`, `9/21` (month first),
 *     `9/21/2026`, "Sep 21", "September 21st", "21 September", "September 21,
 *     2026" — a year written with the date is the year meant; without one,
 *     `yearFor` picks it. A word in front of a date bounds it (2026-10-09):
 *     "since" runs from the date to today (a month too); "before" / "prior to"
 *     is every day before it, "after" every day after it, open-ended; "until",
 *     "till", "up to", "up until" and "by" every day through it — but a date
 *     that names a thing on it ("before the 7/22 flight", "after July 22's
 *     standup") keeps its own day under "before" and "after" (review of #338).
 *     An open end is `OPEN_START` / `OPEN_END`, and a bounded window never
 *     stretches. A month and day with no year under "since" or "after" that
 *     has not come yet this year is last year's ("since 10/25" asked on
 *     10-03). An amount is not a date: "7-8 hours", "3/4 cup", "$5-10", and a
 *     fraction after a word of quantity ("cut it by 1/2"; "finish by 1/2" is
 *     still January 2) (2026-10-09); a leading zero ("09-28 minutes") keeps
 *     it a date (review of #345);
 *   - **anchors**: an event ("around the cut-over", "during the release") or
 *     the last session ("where did we leave off", "last session"). This file
 *     only names them; the caller resolves them against the store, because a
 *     date for "the cut-over" is a search, and "the last session" is a fact
 *     about this directory's sessions.
 *
 * STRETCH. A fuzzy window (a week, a month, part of a month) widens two days
 * each side, a near one ("3 days ago") one day; a named day or date stays
 * exact. `said` is the window as asked, `window` the one that filters.
 *
 * Deliberate only, and facts only. NO MODEL CALL: fixed lists and the store's
 * clock. Pure: `now` and `zone` come in.
