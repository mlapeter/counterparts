/**
 * Per-session gate state — PERSISTED (owner ruling, `docs/module-map.md` Rulings §3).
 *
 * This file exists because of the harvest's most consequential single finding:
 * in v1 the object holding "what surfaced this session", the refractory countdown
 * and the carried cues was constructed fresh every turn and thrown away, because
 * the turn path is a new process per turn and nothing serialized it. Session
 * dedup, the emotional refractory, refractory suppression of arrival cues and
 * cue carry-over were therefore **specified, implemented, tested, and inert on
 * the live path** — exercised only by an in-process replay loop.
 *
 * The generalized lesson, and the reason this module is a file rather than a
 * parameter: **a pure function over caller-owned state is only as real as its
 * caller.** So the state lives in box 2 (canonical operational SQLite, the store's
 * `meta` seam), keyed by session id, and `test/recall.test.ts` asserts that two
 * separate `Recall` instances over two separate `Store` handles — a fresh process,
 * for all this module can tell — share it.
 *
 * **Store:** the `gate_session` TABLE in box 2 — ONE ROW PER RECORD, keyed
 * `(session_id, kind, ref)`. It replaced the single JSON `meta` row at
 * `recall.gate.<sessionId>` on 2026-08-25 (SEAMS item B), which was the fix
 * INTERFACE-GAPS.md #1 asked for and the reason it asked:
 *
 *   > `setMeta` is transactional per call, but `load → mutate → save` is not, so
 *   > two writers on one session — a turn's `recall()` and a late `resolveUse()`
 *   > from the boundary, in different processes — can have the second save drop
 *   > the first's records.
 *
 * That is scar §2.1's own sentence arriving inside a transactional database,
 * because the transaction was around the wrong span. With a row per record the
 * late writer inserts ITS record and cannot touch anybody else's. A merge-on-save
 * would have been the sidecar-plus-discipline answer the scar rejects.
 *
 * **Lifetime:** the session, then `Store.pruneGateSessions()` — a real retention
 * sweep beside `pruneSupersededVersions`, which a meta keyspace could never have.
 * `MAX_SESSION_RECORDS` still bounds the per-session record maps, applied on the
 * write AND on the read, so neither direction can exceed it.
 * **Observer:** never written. An instrument deposits nothing, so its gate state
 * lives and dies in the process (`Recall` holds it in memory and stands down at
 * the write).

/**
 * Why this exists, and why it holds NEIGHBOURS rather than a vector.
 *
 * `Turn.vector` has been an input since this module was written and NEITHER live
 * path ever set it: the hook built its turn without one and the deliberate tool
 * built its own. Measured on the live store 2026-09-04 — 13,862 embeddings that
 * nothing live consulted, and a semantic channel that existed only in tests and
 * in the sweep's card preselection.
 *
 * The obvious fix — embed the prompt on the way in — is the one v1 shipped
 * (`~/bansai/hooks/surface.ts:82-88`: "a cold cache calls Voyage and the latency
 * race covers it"), and it is how "no second LLM call" quietly became untrue
 * there. It is also unaffordable here: every hook is a fresh process that
 * already spends 700-1000 ms cold against a 1200 ms budget, and `recall.build`
 * is a synchronous pass with checkpoints, not a race — an overrun does not
 * degrade the channel, it aborts the turn.
 *
 * **OWNER RULING (2026-09-04): do not embed on the hot path.** Compute the cue
 * after the turn, in the detached worker, and use it on the NEXT turn — exactly
 * the one-turn lag `carriedCues` already runs on.
 *
 * **And resolve it in the worker too.** Measured here, hermetically, at the live
 * store's size: `Store.nearestTo` over 13,862 stored vectors costs 590-1040 ms,
 * because `cache.nearest` reads and `JSON.parse`s every row. Carrying the raw
 * 1024-float vector across the lag would have moved the embedding call off the
 * hot path and left the SCAN on it — the same abort, one layer down. So the
 * worker embeds AND ranks, and what crosses the lag is the top-M `{id, score}`
 * slice the activation pass would have computed: ~200 bytes, already the shape
 * `activate()` consumes. (A deliberate deviation from "carry the vector": the
 * vector is not kept, because nothing on the hot path could afford to use it —
 * constitution line 15.)
 *
 * **Expiry: exactly one turn**, the same rule and for the same reason as
 * `carriedCues`. The row stamps the session's SERVED turn count at the moment it
 * was written; it is usable only while that number is still the served count,
 * i.e. on the very next turn. A second turn without a fresh row reads `stale`.
 * Retention beyond that is `Store.pruneGateSessions()`, which sweeps this row
 * with the rest of the session's.
 *
 * **A failure is a NAMED STATE, never silence** (scar §2.4). The worker writes
 * this row on every run, including the runs where it could not embed, so "the
 * embedder has no credential" is a word in the decision record rather than an
 * absence indistinguishable from "nothing was near".
