/**
 * `recall/` — retrieval and priming. Cues → activation → the surfacing gate → a
 * bounded injection, plus the footnote tier, plus noticing afterwards whether a
 * surfaced memory was actually used.
 *
 * The module's spine, and where each piece lives:
 *
 *   `cues.ts`      strip host boilerplate, then rarity-weighted, word-bounded cues
 *   `feeling-ask.ts` a deliberate question about feeling, and what a stamp answers to
 *   `activate.ts`  three channels — cue, semantic, arrival — against the cache box
 *   `gate.ts`      the hard gates, this turn's own background bar, the tiers
 *   `session.ts`   per-session gate state, PERSISTED (the ruling this module exists to honor)
 *   `render.ts`    composed budget, explicit trim order, tail sentinel
 *   `tunables.ts`  every knob, in one visible place
 *
 * Two properties are structural here and worth stating at the top:
 *
 * **BUILD and RECORD are separate steps** (contract §5 G3). `build()` is pure with
 * respect to durable state: it reads, scores, gates and composes, and writes
 * nothing — not gate state, not telemetry. `recall()` calls it and then records.
 * That split is what makes guarantee 2 achievable: **a latency-budget abort has
 * zero side effects** — nothing injected, nothing buffered, no telemetry, no fire
 * budget spent. *A slow subconscious is worse than a quiet one.*
 *
 * **NO GENERATIVE MODEL CALL, EVER, on this path.** There is no client, no fetch,
 * no URL in this directory, and a test enumerates that. An embedding may be
 * consulted — but only as an INPUT the caller supplies, and its absence degrades
 * to lexical-only rather than failing (contract §5 G1).
