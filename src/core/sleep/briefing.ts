/**
 * The wake briefing re-render — the cycle's LAST content write.
 *
 * `self/` owns the briefing: what goes in it, the composed byte budget, the trim
 * order, the header/sentinel counts, and the atomic publish (`self/CONTRACT.md`
 * §5 G1–G3). `sleep/` owns exactly one thing about it: that it happens LAST,
 * after revision, so it sees this boundary's own supersedes, promotions, merges,
 * and prunes (CONTRACT §3 G5).
 *
 * `self/` is being built in parallel, so this module DOES NOT IMPORT IT. The
 * seam is an injected `RenderFn`; a test asserts sleep imports nothing from
 * `../self/`. When self's render export exists, the wiring is one line at the
 * coordinator — see INTERFACE-GAPS.md §2.
 *
 * A missing renderer is `did-not-run` with reason `no-render-fn`, NOT a failure
 * and NOT "ran and found nothing" (§5 G6, scar §2.4). The three are different
 * records and a wake that never got re-rendered must be visible as such.
 *
 * Zero generative calls: this module calls the function it was handed and counts
 * bytes. Whatever the renderer does is the renderer's contract, and the launch
 * ruling is that it renders WITHOUT a model (module-map ruling 3).
