/**
 * `sleep/` — systems consolidation: pure math on a cycle.
 *
 * The librarian. It advances the lived-day clock, materializes strength into the
 * ranking cache, marks consolidation and executes the identity crossing, prunes
 * at the floor (archivally), dedups, expires superseded-version rows, re-renders
 * the wake briefing (the last CONTENT write), and finally sweeps the durable
 * event log past its retention window — bounded per pass, latched records kept
 * (CONTRACT §5 G16).
 *
 * **Zero generative model calls, asserted by a test over this module's sources**
 * (CONTRACT §5 G1). Embedding lookups are permitted arithmetic and arrive
 * INJECTED, isolated, and degrading to lexical — never as a dependency of this
 * module.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT contain, and why:
 *
 *   - **The lock, the watchdog, and detachment** (§3, scars E4/E5). Those belong
 *     to the adapter that spawns the cycle; the cross-key configuration
 *     invariant that binds them is here, as `validateWatchdog`, because it is
 *     arithmetic. INTERFACE-GAPS.md §6.
 *   - **The briefing itself.** `self/` owns it. Sleep owns only that it is last.
 *   - **Any import from `../self/`.** A test asserts the absence.
