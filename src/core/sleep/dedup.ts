/**
 * The dedup pass — physics' verdicts over cache-provided candidates.
 *
 * The rule that matters most is a REFUSAL: **a memory that declares `updates:`
 * is never merged into its target** (`physics/` §5.7, CONTRACT §5 G9). A
 * refutation is topically as close to the belief it refutes as anything in the
 * store; merging it would credit a use to that belief and reinforce it. That is
 * scar §2.10's one-way ratchet, rebuilt by accident. Physics checks the
 * declaration FIRST, before hash and before cosine, and this phase never
 * second-guesses it.
 *
 * **Candidates are the cache's job, not physics'.** The shipped default is
 * lexical and free: identical content hashes, read from box 2. An
 * embedding-backed source (cosine over box 3) is INJECTED, is permitted
 * arithmetic rather than a generative call (§4), and is isolated per call — if
 * it throws, the pass degrades to hash-only and says so, rather than failing the
 * cycle (scar E1). Ambiguous near-duplicates are left alone (§5.7, owner
 * decision): accepted rent, paid for zero substrate confabulation.
 *
 * The same refusal has a second half, found 2026-09-04 on the first store that
 * ever crossed the pressure bar: **a revision's successor is never the losing
 * candidate of a same-hash merge** (`revisionSuccessorPair` and the wider clause
 * in `runDedup` below). The declaration guard cannot reach it — that declaration
 * names the PREDECESSOR — and the successor's body IS its challenger's body by
 * construction, so the merge fired on the revision's own evening and the revised
 * belief stopped being a belief. The rule is stated as "never the loser" rather
 * than as a pair, because a THIRD row with the same text (the same sentence
 * noted twice) takes the original's seat and the pair relation reads false
 * against it — and then the element loses its only live version.
 *
 * The same refusal has a THIRD half, and it is the widest of the three: **a
 * `type: "schema"` row is not a dedup candidate at all** (`types.ts#isSchemaRow`,
 * read where the live set is built, so both candidate sources are covered by
 * construction). A belief is a standing claim about a person or a thing, with
 * its own revision machinery and its own refusal to blend (`schemas/` §5.6,
 * §5 G1, §5 G4); "these two say the same thing, so they are one thing" is a
 * claim about NOTES. Probe H, found by the adversarial review on 2026-09-04:
 * an `addBelief` with statement X and a memory with body X, born the same day,
 * no revision anywhere — the belief lost the tie-break and stopped being a
 * belief. Migration settles the DIRECTION of that loss and not its frequency:
 * migrated elements were minted at the import day while migrated memories kept
 * their v1 birth day, so on any such pair the memory is never younger and the
 * element always loses — but a pair needs two distinct v1 items whose gated
 * text is byte-identical, and how often that happened is unknown until the
 * owner's dry run counts it. G9b is NOT made redundant by this: `revision.ts`'s identity arm mints
 * its successor as `type: "memory"`, and only G9b stands between that row and
 * the challenger whose words it carries.
 *
 * **A merge is `uses(original) += 1` and the duplicate ARCHIVES.** Both halves
 * are load-bearing. Without the credit the merge is a deletion; without the
 * exit the same pair is found again tomorrow and credited again — a uses ratchet
 * and a direct breach of the replay-idempotence guarantee (§5 G3). Archive, not
 * delete: the duplicate keeps its prose and its id.
