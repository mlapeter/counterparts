/**
 * The consolidation cycle — the librarian's whole run.
 *
 * Five properties live in this file, and every one of them is a test:
 *
 * 1. **Phase order is behavior** (§5 G5). `PHASES` is the order; the report
 *    echoes the order actually executed so an assertion can compare them.
 * 2. **Completion markers make a crash resumable** (§5 G4). A marker advances
 *    only after the work AND its persist succeed, and only forward. A cycle
 *    killed mid-phase leaves earlier markers advanced and the killed phase's
 *    marker where it was, so the rerun neither redoes nor skips.
 * 3. **A budget is not a debt** (§3, v1 §5 G4). Per-phase budgets cap effort;
 *    the marker still advances when a budget truncates a phase, and
 *    `skippedForBudget` is reported rather than carried as arrears.
 * 4. **Degrade, don't abort** (§5 G6). A phase that throws is caught, recorded
 *    as `failed` with its code, and the cycle continues — with its marker NOT
 *    advanced, so the work is retried on the next lived day. The one exception
 *    is `CycleKilled`, which is a process kill wearing an exception's clothes
 *    and must not be papered over.
 * 5. **An observer runs the whole cycle as a read-only report** (§5 G10, scar
 *    E7). Every phase computes; `ctx.apply` is false, so not one `WRITE_METHOD`
 *    is called — the report is produced without a single stand-down, because
 *    nothing was ever attempted. The spawner's own answer is separate and
 *    blunter: `shouldSpawn()` says no.
 *
 * ZERO GENERATIVE MODEL CALLS. There is no client, no fetch, no network import
 * anywhere in this module, and a test scans the source to say so.
