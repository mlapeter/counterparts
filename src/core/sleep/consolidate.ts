/**
 * Consolidation, and the ONE place identity promotion happens.
 *
 * Redesigned 2026-09-26 with the owner (dreaming + consolidation). Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. **The LEGACY consolidation marking.** Until schema v8 a memory that had
 *    survived a lived day at or above the semantic floor was marked
 *    `consolidated`, worth a one-time `+CONS_BONUS` to `base` for the rest of
 *    its life. That path is now open ONLY to memories born before the upgrade
 *    (`legacy`, physics §5.2) — exactly the rows that had it — so the upgrade
 *    moves nothing down a band and prunes nothing sooner. Every memory made
 *    since earns durability from RETURNS instead (physics §5.11): each spaced
 *    return slows its fading, credited at the moment of the use (or of a
 *    dream's replay), not here. The criterion is still physics'
 *    (`consolidationEligibility`), and a post-upgrade memory is refused
 *    `not-legacy` by it.
 *
 * 2. **Core promotion — HERE AND ONLY HERE**, now by LANES (physics §5.3):
 *    only a memory about me, about us or about the owner can become core — by
 *    its MARK (v9, 2026-09-27: `me`, `us`, `owner`, set by an awake model that
 *    read it; `aboutMe` below) — by the fast lane (strongly felt, and it came
 *    back after a gap) or the slow lane (it kept coming back over weeks).
 *    Physics decides eligibility; this phase reads the mark, honours the
 *    owner's demotions, and caps the
 *    night at `CORE_MAX_PER_SLEEP`, strongest first — the rest wait for the
 *    next consolidation. The crossing is an EXPLICIT, COUNTED EVENT with a
 *    persisted record carrying its lane, never an emergent side effect of a
 *    number drifting past a line (scar §2.4). Nothing is born into identity;
 *    this and revision inheritance are the only two doors, and a dream's
 *    nomination is not one (`core/dream/`).
 *
 * Arithmetic only: this phase never calls a model.
