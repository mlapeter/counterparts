/**
 * The decay tick — synaptic downscaling, as a cache refresh.
 *
 * What this phase does: recompute `strength(m, d)` and `band(m, d)` for every
 * live memory and materialize the result into the ranking cache (box 3) — and,
 * since 2026-09-14, write each row's band back to the box-2 `band` column when
 * the column disagrees with the arithmetic.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, and cannot: apply a decay STEP to canonical state.
 * Strength is a pure function of stored state and the lived day, so there is no
 * "step" to apply and nothing to double-apply. `uses`, `lastUsedDay` and the
 * prose are untouched. v1 materialized decay into canonical files (~1.9K file
 * writes a day); v2 received that as an open choice with the evidence attached
 * (behavioral-spec §11) and declined it, and still declines it.
 *
 * THE BAND COLUMN IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is a reconciliation rather than a
 * materialization (IMPROVEMENTS U8, 2026-09-14). `band(m, d)` is the same pure
 * function either way; the column existed as a fossil — episodic at mint,
 * identity at promotion, and never "semantic" — so on the live store 869 rows
 * were semantic in the cache and episodic in the table, and every surface that
 * read the column (the `status` tool's `byBand`) reported a number the system
 * itself did not believe. A pass that EMITS `band.transition` rows and leaves
 * the table contradicting them is a pass that lies in two places at once
 * (constitution 16). So: one UPDATE per row whose column is wrong, never a
 * strength write, never a row that already agrees — a caught-up store writes a
 * handful a day, and a replayed day writes nothing at all. See `NOTES.md` §5.
 *
 * THE SKIP LIST IS BEHAVIOR, and each skip is reported separately (§3, v1 §11
 * G5). Note what "skipped" means here: because the recompute is arithmetic, an
 * identity-band memory is not branched around — `physics.decay()` returns D = 1
 * for it, so the exemption IS the arithmetic. The category is still counted,
 * because "how many rows did not move, and why" is the question the telemetry
 * exists to answer, and a category that is structurally zero is a different
 * record from one that never fired (scar §2.4).
 *
 * CALM BY DEFAULT (v1 §11 G8): a row is written only when it actually moves
 * past `DECAY_QUANTUM` or changes band. A quiet day writes almost nothing.
 *
 * AND — since 2026-08-25 — THIS IS THE ONE PLACE BAND MOVES ARE COUNTED BY
 * DIRECTION, which is what makes `physics.symmetryCheck` (guarantee 12, scar
 * §2.10) a live tripwire instead of a function nobody calls.
 *
 * One place, deliberately, and the reason is arithmetic. Every way a band can
 * change is visible HERE, because `band(m, d)` is a pure function of stored
 * state and this pass reads it for every live row against its last reading:
 *
 *   - a DECAY DEMOTION (semantic→episodic) is only ever a number falling back
 *     under `THETA_SEM`, so this pass is the only place it exists at all —
 *     it was v1's dominant crossing, 268 of 345;
 *   - a REVISION-DRIVEN demotion is the same fact: a challenged memory's
 *     strength moves, and the next tick reads the new band. `schemas/` writes
 *     no band and neither does `supersede` — a source scan says so;
 *   - the IDENTITY CROSSING is a decision `consolidate/` makes and records for
 *     itself, and it becomes a band move here on the next tick, because
 *     `promotedIdentity` makes `band()` answer "identity".
 *
 * Counting the crossing at the promotion site TOO would count it twice — the
 * cache diff has no way to know a move was already recorded — and a
 * double-counted up-move is a ratchet tripwire lying in the ratchet's own
 * direction. So the promotion's up-move is counted one lived day later, which
 * is a lag in a counter whose sample threshold is 20 moves across the whole
 * history, and is the price of having exactly one definition of a crossing.
