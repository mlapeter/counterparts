/**
 * The chunk — the one entrance, and the place "gated means gated" is enforced.
 *
 * A chunk is a unit of experience with proposals attached. `encodeChunk` is the
 * ONLY function in this module that produces `DurableEffect`s, which is what makes
 * scar §7's acceptance criterion enumerable rather than arguable: one chokepoint,
 * and a rejected input moves zero durable state, ASSERTED PER STATE KIND.
 *
 * **A fully-gated chunk moves NO durable state — not strength, not `uses`, not a
 * revision, not an entity mention, and not a prediction check.** That last one is
 * the rider, and it is the whole reason the rule is stated at the chunk level
 * rather than the proposal level: in v1, once gradient reinforcement went live,
 * prediction checks were found to bypass the gate, so *a chunk the gates had
 * rejected could still reinforce schema elements* as an element-level side effect
 * (scar §7b). Ruled strict: "the lost reinforcement signal is affordable; the leak
 * in the non-ablatable wall is not."
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to ALL-REJECTED. A chunk with one survivor was gated in
 * part, not refused (§3 G2) — and then only the survivor's effects exist.
 *
 * Encode writes nothing itself. It returns intents; `remember/` applies them. That
 * is why this file imports `hashText` from the store's prose module and NOTHING
 * from the store's write surface.
