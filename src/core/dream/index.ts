/**
 * `dream/` — dreaming: a background pass over what was lived since the last
 * dream, by the same model, through one tool with phases (owner decisions
 * 2026-09-26). CONTRACT.md has the lineage and the guarantees; this file is the
 * mechanism.
 *
 * The shape, in one paragraph. Once a CALENDAR day (2026-09-28: the NIGHTLY
 * RUN), the first session is handed a line (`offer`, claimed by `claimOffer`;
 * `askLine` is both) that follows the owner's setting: `ask` (the default,
 * 2026-09-29) — the person is shown the question in the terminal and says
 * "dream"; `auto` — the run starts on its own in the background; `off` —
 * nothing. The session asks this module for the
 * LAUNCH PROMPT (`launchPrompt`) and hands it to ONE background agent — same
 * model, same tools, its writes attributed to the session that launched it —
 * which runs the page writer, then the dream, then the reflection
 * (`NIGHT_ORDER`). The dreamer calls `begin` and is SHOWN a bundle:
 * the self page, the wake, the journal since the last dream, the owner's card,
 * every memory made since the last dream with its nearest older neighbours, a
 * few loosely related older ones, and the strongest-feeling memories of about a
 * week back — all through recall's gates, never a raw list. It then `propose`s
 * changes, each applied within per-dream limits and recorded so the whole dream
 * can be undone: merge near-copies (originals kept, archived with a forwarding
 * address), link two memories, replay (a return at half weight — never a use),
 * write a gist in its own words (source `dreamed`, starting low), flag a
 * contradiction (a pair in `contradictions`, unsettled) or — with a clear
 * reason — settle one (2026-09-29), record how an old charged memory feels
 * now, nominate a memory for the core (a lane still has to promote it). Last it
 * writes its `journal` entry, which lives in the `dreams` table and never
 * becomes a memory, and hands back one marked line.
 *
 * What a dream CANNOT do, by construction: delete, edit the self page,
 * promote, rewrite a memory in place, or touch a memory it was not shown. A
 * dream's words never enter the sweep: the hand-back and the bundle carry
 * `DREAM_MARK`, and `remember/`'s `enters()` refuses any turn that does.
 *
 * Arithmetic and bookkeeping only: nothing here calls a model — the dreamer IS
 * the model, outside this process.
