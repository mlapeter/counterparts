/**
 * The remember→encode bridge — SEAMS.md items 1–3 close here.
 *
 * remember/ owns authorship mechanics and deliberately injects its gate;
 * encode/ owns the battery and deliberately holds no store handle. This file is
 * the one place the two are composed, so the composition rules live in exactly
 * one spot:
 *
 *   1. CHUNK-LEVEL GATED-MEANS-GATED: fallback-sweep chunks route through
 *      `encodeChunk`, whose all-rejected rule already returns zero durable
 *      effects (including prediction checks). The bridge adds no second
 *      implementation — it routes.
 *   2. THE EMOTION EXEMPTION IS ENGINE-SET HERE, from the proposal's source: a
 *      session-end dump or an in-the-moment jot IS the experiencer writing, so
 *      its feelings are self-authored; a fallback sweep's are not. No author
 *      field can claim it (encode validates; remember's drafts can't carry it).
 *   3. Claimed salience, dimensions, and title-as-handle reach the battery, and
 *      a battery refusal is marked `refusedByDesign` so callers can tell a
 *      working gate from a broken one.
 *   4. SEAMS item H: EPISODES route through the same battery. `self/`'s default
 *      episode gate REFUSES everything ("an absent gate is not an open one"), and
 *      `episodeGate()` below is what makes that default unreachable in
 *      production. Episode ingestion was v1's most heavily gated surface — 66% of
 *      all gate fires (scar §2.7) — and a first-person reflection is not exempt
 *      from never durably encoding a credential.

 * composition root binds all three members; absent, both gates behave exactly as
 * they did before one existed (novelty null, reason `no-chunk-vector`).
 *
 * Only the AUTHORED door takes one. `GateFn` may return a promise and
 * `submitProposal` awaits it, so that door can pay for a live embedding;
 * `EpisodeGate` is synchronous AND its verdict has nowhere to carry a novelty
 * number, so `episodeGate()` takes no source at all rather than computing one to
 * throw away (INTERFACE-GAPS §8c).
 *
 * Every member is asked for the text AS THE STORE WILL INDEX IT — the gate's
 * output, never the author's draft. That is what makes one embedding serve both
 * the novelty measurement and box 3, and it is also the egress rule: nothing
 * reaches this interface that has not already been through the battery.

/**
 * Per-proposal gate for the authored paths (session-end dumps and jots).
 *
 * With a `VectorSource` the returned gate is ASYNC (a live embedding is one
 * network call), which `GateFn` permits and `remember/submitProposal` awaits.
 * WITHOUT one it stays synchronous — not for speed, but because a gate that
 * became a promise for every caller would silently break any caller reading
 * `verdict.ok` off the return value.
 *
 * **THE BATTERY RUNS BEFORE THE SOCKET DOES.** The first version of this
 * function embedded `input.content` — the author's RAW draft — and then gated
 * it, which put un-redacted text on the wire: a credential in a session-end dump
 * reached the embedding provider verbatim while the prose written to disk was
 * correctly redacted. The secrets gate is not ablatable and "durable" is not its
 * scope; egress is egress. So the order here is the order the sweep door already
 * used (`counterpart.applySweep` warms `result.accepted`, post-gate):
 *
 *   1. gate the proposal, with novelty NOT YET KNOWN;
 *   2. a refusal returns immediately — nothing refused is ever embedded;
 *   3. embed the GATE'S text, which is also the text the store will index;
 *   4. compute novelty against E(m) and attach it to the verdict.
 *
 * Step 1 costs nothing in correctness because the battery's accept/refuse never
 * consults novelty: `gateProposal` reads `input.novelty` only AFTER its refusal
 * branch has returned, to tag the accepted proposal's salience and to emit
 * `encode.blind`. Both of those are discarded here (this function returns a
 * `GateVerdict`, not an `AcceptedProposal`, and drops `outcome.events`), so the
 * placeholder cannot leak a wrong number into telemetry either — the novelty
 * that survives is the one attached in step 4.
