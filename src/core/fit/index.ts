/**
 * `fit/` — fitting what a mechanism has into the room it has (2026-09-28).
 * CONTRACT.md states the principle; this file is the arithmetic. Working
 * defaults, held lightly.
 *
 * The shape: a mechanism hands N candidates, each with a PRIORITY it computed
 * itself (the dream ranks by replay priority, the reflection by feeling), a
 * one-line form and a whole form, and a ROOM in characters. It gets back, in
 * priority order, what each candidate is shown as — its whole text, an
 * excerpt, its line, or only its id — with the whole length beside every one,
 * and the ids that did not fit at all, which WAIT. Breadth first: every
 * candidate gets its id, then its line, before any gets its whole text; then
 * the whole texts go to the most important, filling past a misfit (a smaller
 * one later may still fit). Nothing is cut without its length being said.
 *
 * Three small readers ride along, because every mechanism needs them the same
 * way: `lineOf` (what a memory is called, in one line), `derivedFrom` (what a
 * row was made from), and `packParts` (a result too long for one tool answer,
 * in parts). And the LOOKUP LEDGER: each fit's index — which ids were offered
 * as lines, which whole — kept in one meta row per mechanism, so the recall
 * tool can count how often a receiver fetched what an index offered
 * (`noteLookups`). That count is the check against "just truncated again".
 *
 * Arithmetic and bookkeeping only; nothing here calls a model.

 *
 * MEASURED, not guessed: the night of 2026-10-02 (and of 10-01) Claude Code
 * handed the model a 2 KB preview of every result over the line and saved the
 * rest to a file the headless run cannot open, so the dream saw a third of
 * its bundle. Read from Claude Code 2.1.287 itself, there are two lines:
 *
 *   - `HOST_CHARS`: a result whose text runs past 50,000 characters (the
 *     host's global persist threshold, under the MCP tool's own 100,000) is
 *     saved to a file — "Output too large (51.5KB)". The text it measures is
 *     `structuredContent` serialized compact, when a result carries one.
 *   - `HOST_TOKENS`: an MCP result past 25,000 tokens (`MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`,
 *     counted for real past ~12,500 estimated) is saved the same way — "result
 *     (51,306 characters) exceeds maximum allowed tokens". That part ran about
 *     two characters a token: the bundle is JSON escaped inside JSON.
 *
 * `CHARS` is the room: 20% under both at that density, so a result measured
 * by `wireChars` (a non-ASCII character as three) under it reaches the model
 * whole. The env var could raise the token line; nothing raises the 50,000. CAL.
