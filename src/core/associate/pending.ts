/**
 * The pending file — co-activation deltas ON DISK, between the process that
 * noticed them and the process that writes them down.
 *
 * **Why it exists.** `coactivate()` accumulates pair deltas in an in-process
 * buffer and `flush()` turns them into edge rows. On a host whose every hook is
 * a fresh process those two halves run in different processes: the credit pass
 * runs inside a Stop hook, and the flush runs in the detached worker that Stop
 * spawns. For the whole of the parallel run the buffer therefore died at hook
 * exit and no edge was ever written. The first fix ran the flush inside the
 * hook, which works — and puts two SQLite writes on a path that meets the
 * worker's own write lock (I38: `database is locked` in 3 of 8 runs, and an
 * adversarial probe measured 5.3 s per write under a held lock, with the drained
 * deltas recorded nowhere afterwards). This file is the other answer, and it is
 * the lesson this week already taught in `sessions.ts`: **a value one hook
 * writes and a later process reads has to be on disk.**
 *
 * So the hook appends; the worker claims, applies and removes. The hook takes no
 * database lock for association at all.
 *
 * **Where it lives, and why not the top level.** `<dataDir>/sessions/association/`.
 * `Store.assertLayout()` runs in the store's CONSTRUCTOR and refuses any
 * top-level entry it cannot classify, so a new top-level file would stop every
 * store opened by code that predates it — and after a deploy the MCP servers of
 * already-running sessions are exactly that code. `sessions/` is already
 * classified (host state, `backup: false`), `adapters/expansions.ts` already
 * keeps a log inside it for the same reason, and a SUBDIRECTORY is also out of
 * `pruneSessions`'s reach: it removes files, and its `rmSync` without
 * `recursive` leaves a directory alone.
 *
 * `SESSIONS_DIR` is spelled again here rather than imported: `adapters/` are
 * leaves and core may not import one. The name is classified in
 * `store/paths.ts` LAYOUT, and `test/sessions.test.ts` pins the two spellings
 * against each other.
 *
 * Four rules the code below mechanizes:
 *
 *   1. **Appends are appends.** One `appendFileSync` per line with `O_APPEND`,
 *      each line small, so two hook processes writing at once interleave whole
 *      lines rather than clobbering each other.
 *   2. **Nothing here throws at a caller.** A hook may not fail its host
 *      (`claude-code/CONTRACT.md` §5 G2); every entry point reports a failure
 *      in its return value instead.
 *   3. **A claim is a rename ASIDE** (the choreography `remember/spans.ts`
 *      already carries): a concurrent append lands in a fresh pending file and
 *      cannot be destroyed by the claim, and a claim whose apply failed is left
 *      where it is, for the next run to find.
 *   4. **Counts, ids and weights only.** Never a byte of any memory's text.
