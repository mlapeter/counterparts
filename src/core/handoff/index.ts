/**
 * THE HANDOFF — where the work in THIS directory stands, for the next session
 * that opens here.
 *
 * It is not a memory, and that is the whole of its design. A memory is an
 * interpretation of what was learned; a handoff is working context — "what I was
 * doing here" — which is true for a fortnight and then is not true at all. v1
 * had the same lane under the name `task-state`, expiring; the spec's §6.4 is
 * where it comes back, and the owner's words for why (§15 item 6) are that today
 * he types "prep a handoff so we can pick up from here in a new session" and
 * wants that to happen on its own.
 *
 * **Never a memory** — every clause below is a mechanism, not a promise:
 *
 *   - **Not recalled.** `recall/activate.ts` skips the row in the scan, the way
 *     it skips the self page, and `creditReferences` refuses it a use even when
 *     a session expands it by id. Nothing here ever accrues `uses` or
 *     `reinforced_days`, so `physics#promotionEligibility` — which needs
 *     reinforcement on N distinct lived days — can never be satisfied and the
 *     row can never cross into the identity band.
 *   - **Not consolidated, never identity, never in "Who I am".** `scanActive`
 *     lists `{ type: "memory" }` and this is a schema row, so no briefing lane
 *     can reach it. The pointer the wake prints is FURNITURE, like the page and
 *     the day-0 line: the lane counts and the sentinel's `elements=` are
 *     untouched by it.
 *   - **Exempt from dedup**, free, by `sleep/types.ts#isSchemaRow`: a schema row
 *     is not a duplicate candidate.
 *   - **Invisible to `schemas/`**: `toMetaRecord` returns null for any role but
 *     entity, belief and current-state, so the index build skips it.
 *   - **It is let go by the ordinary means.** The row is NOT `protected` — the
 *     one thing the self page is and this is not. It is born in the episodic
 *     band with nothing on any salience dimension, so it decays like anything
 *     else and `physics#pruneVerdict` archives it once it is under the floor and
 *     has dwelt `D_FLOOR_DAYS`. Nothing new forgets it; the existing forgetting
 *     does.
 *
 * **One live pointer per directory PER SESSION** (2026-09-30). A session writing
 * again for the same scope is an ordinary `store.revise` of ITS OWN row, so the
 * one it replaces becomes an ordinary version and the row keeps its whole chain
 * — the self page's precedent (`self/page.ts`, "ONE ROW FOR THE LIFE OF THE
 * PAGE"), chosen over an archived row because a superseded row is one more thing
 * `revise`'s readers have to find and because `pruneSupersededVersions` already
 * bounds versions at the ordinary retention. A DIFFERENT session writing in the
 * same directory mints its own row: until 2026-09-30 it revised the same one,
 * and several sessions often work in one repo at once, so the last to end
 * overwrote the others' pointers (that day, "Two builds are in flight" was
 * replaced by a session that knew nothing of either). The wake shows every live
 * one for the directory, newest first, each saying which session wrote it.
 *
 * **It expires in LIVED days** (`store.livedDay()`), not calendar days, because
 * a fortnight of holidays is not a fortnight of work. An expired handoff stops
 * being shown and stops being written over: the row is simply left to the prune.

 * lost 4 of its 6 identity elements, at 2,000 it lost 4 of 13, at 3,000 five of

 * and drops the pointer whole. Eight is chosen so that the reserve can never
 * cost more than an eighth of the bundle, which at the measured block size
 * turned the reserve on from about 2,400 bytes up — about 3,000 since the

 *      for byte.
 *   2. **Sized to the block that EXISTS**, not to the widest one that could. The
 *      review measured 295 bytes of ceiling left unused at budget 2,000 — five

 *      The boundary already knows which handoffs are live and what their

 *      pays for it otherwise, and on a small ceiling it pays in memories.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-30 a directory can hold several handoffs, and the caller
 * passes every block a delivery might splice — for such a directory, each
 * rung of its ladder (three shown, two, one, the newest alone). The reserve
 * is the WIDEST of them the share rule allows, so a ceiling too small for
 * three still reserves for one, and several handoffs can never take more than
 * the eighth one could. With one block per directory this is the rule as it
 * was, with one difference: a narrow block in one directory is reserved for
 * even when a wider one elsewhere fails the share, where before the wider one
 * turned the reserve off for both.
