/**
 * THE HOST LIFECYCLE — what every host does with a session, whatever the host.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-30 all of this lived inside `claude-code/hooks.ts`'s
 * `ClaudeCodeAdapter`, because Claude Code was the only host that had a
 * session to live. The parts below were never about Claude Code: they are what
 * a session IS to this memory — it wakes, it recalls at a turn, it is asked
 * (on one pacer) to write itself up, it reaches a boundary where what was said
 * is captured and credited, it may be pointed at an earlier session that ended
 * unwritten, it leaves a note in the live-session registry at each of those
 * moments, and it starts the detached worker that sleeps and decays. A second
 * host — Claude Desktop's chat, which has an MCP server and no hooks — has all
 * of these too, and has none of Claude Code's machinery: no event names, no
 * JSON envelope, no transcript file, no Stop re-fire, no terminal line.
 *
 * So the split is:
 *
 *   - **Here** — `HostLifecycle`, the interface a host adapter drives, and
 *     `Lifecycle`, its one implementation: the wake's composition and the
 *     registry's expectation of it, plain reminders, recall for a turn and its
 *     durable row, the boundary (capture, the retroactive-capture seal, credit,
 *     the orphan tail), the ask's PACING (whether this boundary asks, and for
 *     which chapter — not its words), the next-session write-up pointer, every
 *     registry write, and the worker spawn with its refusal and start counters.
 *   - **In the host's adapter** — how its events arrive and what they are
 *     called, how its output leaves and how much room it has, what its
 *     transcript looks like, the words of its ask, and anything only it has (for
 *     Claude Code: the parallel run's primacy, the wake-arrival check against
 *     the transcript, the update notice, the doctor notice, the first-launch
 *     question, the dream line and the headless nightly run). `ClaudeCodeAdapter`
 *     EXTENDS `Lifecycle`, so its hook bodies read exactly as they did.
 *
 * Nothing here was rewritten on the way over: the bodies moved as they were,
 * their order is their behaviour, and the rows and ring events they leave are
 * the same names with the same fields. `host` is the one addition — which host
 * this lifecycle serves, written onto every registry record it writes
 * (`sessions.ts#SessionRecord.host`, absent reads as Claude Code's).
 *
 * The rules each part keeps are stated where the part is, and they are the
 * claude-code CONTRACT's: no hook fails the host (every method here swallows its
 * own failures or is called inside the adapter's `guard`), telemetry never fails
 * a session, an observer writes nothing, and what cannot fit is deferred, never
 * truncated.
 *
 * It sits beside `sessions.ts` for the reason that file does: every host
 * adapter needs it, and no adapter may import another. It imports no adapter.

 * THE NEXT-SESSION WRITE-UP'S POINTER (roadmap C2, owner 2026-09-23).
 *
 * A session that ended before it was written up — it owes, by `core/coverage/`'s
 * rule, read through `remember/owes.ts#planRetention` — is written up by the
 * NEXT session that starts in its project. The host does not carry its words: it
 * puts a short POINTER beside the wake (Claude Code: in `HookResult.ask`) — how
 * many sessions here are waiting, the oldest one's id, date and size, and the
 * call that fetches it — and the words come back through the MCP door
 * (`mcp/write-up.ts`): `session_end` with `writeUp` and no memories returns the
 * next part, up to ~24 KB; the same call with memories — or `[]`, "nothing
 * worth keeping" — answers it. Nothing leaves the machine beyond what the host
 * already sees; the write-up is in the model's voice. (It is the only route:
 * the opt-in Anthropic API sweep was removed with the key, 2026-09-24.)
 *
 * **Why a pointer (owner's choice, 2026-09-23, option (b) of claude-code
 * INTERFACE-GAPS §15).** Claude Code caps a hook's whole output at 10,000
 * characters and turns anything longer into a preview — of the WAKE, which
 * comes first. On a store whose wake fills its budget there was no room for the
 * words; an MCP result is not under that cap. The pointer names the ended
 * session ONCE and this session once: ~410 bytes with the host's 36-character
 * ids (measured).
 *
 * **Measured against the host's plain-stdout cap, not the reported budget**
 * (PR #192 review, MAJOR 1). The budget is what the WAKE is composed to; with no
 * owner notice `claude-code/bin/hook.ts#hostDelivery` prints the wake and the
 * asks as PLAIN text, which the host caps at 10,000 characters with no JSON
 * escaping to allow for (bytes ≥ characters, so a byte count under the cap is a
 * character count under it). With a notice, `hostDelivery`'s own rule drops the
 * notice when the envelope would not fit — the wake and its asks win, as
 * always. A pointer that does not fit DEFERS, claims nothing, and says so
 * durably (`sessions.ts#WRITE_UP_POINTER_KEY`), which doctor reads. The count
 * is BYTES against a cap in characters — accepted (PR #192 re-review, NIT): it
 * is the safe direction, and it defers early only for a multi-byte wake over
 * ~9,575 bytes, which is already past the 9,000-byte budget `install` writes.
 *
 * **Once per session, and the day's allowance.** A compaction re-firing
 * SessionStart points at nothing; at most `WRITE_UP_ASKS_PER_DAY` sessions a
 * calendar day (local time) are pointed. It MAY COINCIDE with the page writer's
 * ask or the first-launch question — the roadmap's reading of §13 G3, which is
 * about the blocked Stop: both are carried, the other first. Never under
 * observer, never in a directory set `off` (the entry point returns before

  /**
   * THE RETROACTIVE-CAPTURE GUARD (PR #92 review, F1) — the one place a
   * directory that was `off` can still lose its silence.
   *
   * A session that lived under `off` or `paused` wrote NOTHING: no session
   * record, because the hook process returned before a store was opened, and no
   * span cursor for the same reason. Turn the directory back on mid-session —
   * `counterparts scope . --resume`, or the `scope` tool, which is deliberately
   * the one tool that answers in an off directory — and the next boundary sees
   * a cursor of 0 against a transcript holding the WHOLE off conversation. It
   * would deposit all of it. Measured on this branch before this guard: six
   * marker hits in the buffer after the flip.
   *
   * So a boundary that finds NO SESSION RECORD and a cursor still at 0 treats
   * the stretch as somebody else's: it advances the cursor to the end of what
   * it can see, deposits nothing, and records that it did. What follows the
   * flip is captured normally, because the cursor now starts there.
   *
   * **How the cursor moves without a deposit.** `SpanBuffer.capture` advances
   * to `turns.length` when nothing in the slice is capture-eligible
   * (`remember/spans.ts`, the ALL_EXCLUDED arm: "still advance, or the same
   * tool output is re-scanned forever"). So the seal hands it `turns.length`
   * PLACEHOLDERS whose source is `tool` — `enters()` refuses them — and the
   * real turns are never passed to the core at all. That is the only
   * adapter-reachable way to set a cursor today; a `SpanBuffer.sealCursor` in
   * core would be the honest one, and is named in the PR as a core ask.
   *
   * Three conditions, each load-bearing:
   *   - **not an observer**: an observer captures nothing and writes no session
   *     record anyway, and a cursor it cannot write would make the seal a lie.
   *     An `off → observer → on` session is therefore still sealed at the first
   *     boundary after it reaches `on` — the observer stretch left no record.
   *   - **no session record**: the positive evidence that SessionStart ran
   *     inside this memory. It is what a live session has and an off one does not.
   *   - **cursor still 0**: a record PRUNED out from under a long-lived session
   *     (seven days, `sessions.ts`) leaves a cursor behind; that session has
   *     been captured all along and must not lose the turns since its last
   *     boundary.
