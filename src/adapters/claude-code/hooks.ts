/**
 * The hooks — this host's sensory and motor surface.
 *
 * Everything host-specific lives here so the core stays host-agnostic
 * (constitution 5). What a session is to this memory whatever the host — the
 * wake's composition, recall for a turn, the boundary, the ask's pacing, the
 * write-up pointer, the registry writes, the worker — is `../lifecycle.ts`'s
 * `Lifecycle` (2026-09-30), which `ClaudeCodeAdapter` extends; this file keeps
 * what is Claude Code's: its five events, its envelope and the room it
 * measures, its transcript's delivery check, the Stop ask's words, the
 * parallel run's primacy, the notices and the dream line. The rules this file
 * mechanizes, each from the CONTRACT (some of them now in the lifecycle's
 * methods it calls):
 *
 *   **G2 — no hook ever fails the host.** Every entry point below is wrapped in
 *   `guard()`: one try/catch, one logged failure, one safe return. There is no
 *   path out of this file that throws.
 *   **G3 — every session-ending path reaches the boundary.** `SESSION_ENDING`
 *   is the enumeration and `BOUNDARY_KIND` the mapping; `test/claude-code.test.ts`
 *   walks the list and asserts each one claims spans. Compaction destroying the
 *   transcript must not destroy the day (spec §2 G5).
 *   **G4 — host limits are reported, not assumed.** The injection ceiling comes
 *   from configuration and reaches the core as an argument; a bundle that
 *   exceeds it is an EVENT, never a silent truncation (scar §2.18/§2.4).
 *   **G7 — an observer stands down at the hook boundary**, and says so.
 *   **G8 — the read cursor is per-session and advances after a successful
 *   append**, which is `remember/`'s property; the adapter's job is to hand it
 *   the same session key every time and never to re-slice the transcript itself.
 *   **§2.3 — delivery telemetry is distinct from render telemetry.** The wake
 *   states its own sentinel; the FIRST PROMPT of the session reads the head of
 *   the host's transcript and reports what the host recorded as injected. The
 *   expectation is carried in the session registry record, because every hook is
 *   its own process. v1 shipped eleven days of truncated wakes because only the
 *   render was instrumented.
 *   **§2 G10/G11 — conversational text only, and injected context is excluded
 *   from PACING but kept in CAPTURE.** `substanceOf` counts one and
 *   `captureSpans` receives the other; the two are computed from the same turns
 *   in the same function, so they cannot drift apart.
 *   **The parallel run's G3/G5 — exactly one system delivers, and the shadow is
 *   ENCODE-ONLY.** Behind `parallel.enabled` (absent by default), every
 *   DELIVERING hook asks `primacy.ts` first and stands down when the answer is
 *   anything but a clean "engram". A stand-down withholds the wake, the recall
 *   and both asks; it withholds NOTHING from capture, because the shadow's whole
 *   job is to encode the same days v1 encodes. Both verdicts are durable
 *   (parallel-run G4: the mute is evidenced, not asserted).

/**
 * THE ONE STOP ASK — v2's front door and its journal, in one text.
 *
 * The wording is advisory (remember G11 [A], CONTRACT §5 G9); that an ask exists
 * at a session-ending path is what is mechanized. It names the TOOLS, because
 * the RETURN channel is a tool, not a hook: a hook can only put text into the
 * context, and the deposits come back through `Counterpart.submitSessionEnd`
 * and `Counterpart.appendEpisode` — reached, in this host, by the MCP adapter's
 * `session_end` and `chapter` (`mcp/CONTRACT.md`). Filed in
 * `INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7.
 *
 * **ONE ask, not two.** Behavioral-spec §13 G3 said it in v1's words — "the
 * blocked moment carries a single ask; new features do not get to grow it back
 * into two" — and v2 grew it back into two anyway: the authorship ask on its own
 * turn/byte pacer and the episode ask on the chapter pacer, firing at different
 * Stops. Measured 2026-09-04: about a dozen asks in a 13-turn evening. They are
 * one text on one pacer here, and the pacer is the chapter's.
 *
 * The other corrections, all measured the same day:
 *
 *   - **It names the session id and both tools.** The host's MCP servers are
 *     launched from a static config and never learn which session they are
 *     serving, so the id has to travel in the ask — it is what the server binds
 *     itself with (`adapters/sessions.ts`, `mcp/server.ts#requireBoundSession`).
 *     Without it the model reached for `note` 34 times in one session and no
 *     session's dump ever landed. On the Stops where only the episode half
 *     fired, the model got no id and no tool name at all.
 *   - **`updates` is a FIELD.** The old wording said "say `updates: <id>`",
 *     and four notes duly arrived with `updates: mem_x.` as the first words of
 *     their prose — unlinked, because prose is not a field. It is a field on a
 *     `session_end` entry AND on `note`, and since B1 it is the tool
 *     description that says so, not this text.
 *   - **The chapter number is the store's.** It is one past what was WRITTEN,
 *     never one past what was asked, so an unanswered ask does not silently
 *     renumber the journal.
 *   - **Salience is the author's to set.** An unclaimed authored memory takes
 *     a modest default floor, deliberately below the semantic band (`physics/`,
 *     2026-09-04), and the author's own claim is the only channel by which
 *     lived testimony outranks something a sweep noticed — the sweep's claim is
 *     capped where the author's is not. Since B1 the `salience` field's own
 *     description carries this.
 *
 * **SPLIT IN TWO, AND SHORT (B1, owner 2026-09-23).** The person used to read
 * all nine lines of this after every due Stop, printed as `Stop hook error:`,
 * though every word was written for the model (new-user finding #28). Now:
 *
 *   - the PERSON gets `STOP_HUMAN_LINE` — one plain line saying what is
 *     happening, carried as the hook's `systemMessage`
 *     (`bin/hook.ts#hostDelivery`);
 *   - the MODEL gets this: two numbered lines, both naming the session id and
 *     the tool that takes it, plus the two clauses that are about WHETHER to
 *     write — `handoff` only if work here is unfinished (it is a field on the
 *     same `session_end` call, not a third tool and not a second ask: §13 G3),
 *     and, since 2026-10-01, `retireHandoff` for a handoff here whose work is
 *     done, whoever left it (a handoff that waited on a release never learned
 *     the release landed: random-f2's item 1),
 *     and, also since 2026-10-01 (lane 8), to `updates` anything dated or open
 *     that got done here — a dated follow-up kept arriving after it was done,
 *     because nothing prompted the session to close it; how (`eventDate:
 *     null`, `unresolved: false`) is on the field's own description,
 *     and "nothing worth keeping is a real answer", which the server now
 *     accepts as `memories: []`. The words that clause needed came out of
 *     the rest ("what's worth keeping", and "Write chapter N with" for
 *     "Write chapter N of this session's episode with"), so with a real id and a
 *     four-digit chapter number it is 465 characters, inside the 480 pin.
 *
 * Everything else the old text said — `updates` is a FIELD, salience is a floor
 * and the author's to claim, what an episode is for, what a handoff is — is
 * in the tools' own descriptions (`mcp/tools.ts`), where the model reads it at
 * the moment it fills the fields. Saying it again at every Stop is what made
 * this a wall.
 *
 * It opens with `STOP_ASK_OPENER` (`transcript.ts`), which is how the reader
 * recognises this text coming home on a host-written entry and refuses it from
 * capture (`ritual`, CONTRACT §5 G11) whichever emission shape carried it —
 * today's `additionalContext`, or the stderr and `reason` shapes older

      // not get:
      //   1. the owner's notices (doctor, registry) — `bin/hook.ts#hostDelivery`
      //      drops them before the JSON envelope passes `ENVELOPE_CHARS`;
      //   2. the write-up pointer — the next start in this project is pointed;
      //   3. the first-launch scope question — the next session asks;
      //   4. plain reminders due today — the first prompt says them, its
      //      envelope is small, and their beat is not spent here;
      //   5. the wake, never cut here: it was composed to its own budget at the
      //      boundary, where it trims hints → craft → threads → horizon →
      //      identity, identity last. The clock line rides with it.
      // THE BUDGET IS THE FORM THE ENVELOPE WILL TAKE. A plain reminder reaches
      // the person only inside the JSON form (its line is the `systemMessage`),
      // so when one is due and the wake and the reminders fit that form, the
      // two asks are measured against IT — escaped, under `ENVELOPE_CHARS` —
      // and it is they that give way, not the reminder. Otherwise (nothing due,
      // or reminders that cannot fit even beside the wake alone, which the
      // delivery then sends to the first prompt) the form is plain stdout,
