/**
 * The worker's two vector jobs — the half of the semantic channel that is
 * allowed to take a second.
 *
 * **The finding, 2026-09-04, on the live store.** `RecallTurn.vector` has been
 * an input since `recall/` was written and NEITHER live path set it: the
 * UserPromptSubmit hook built its turn without one and the MCP recall tool built
 * its own. So the 13,862 embeddings the store had paid for were consulted by
 * nothing live — the semantic channel existed in tests and in the sweep's card
 * preselection and nowhere a person could feel it. And only the sweep ever
 * warmed a vector, so 40 authored notes, 224 episodes and 288 migrated memories
 * had none at all: the channel was blind to the first-person material even where
 * it did fire.
 *
 * **The ruling (Mike, 2026-09-04): do not embed on the hot path.** Every hook is
 * a fresh process that already spends 700-1000 ms cold against a 1200 ms recall
 * budget, and `recall.build` is a synchronous pass with checkpoints — an overrun
 * does not degrade the channel, it aborts the whole turn. So the cue is computed
 * AFTER a turn and used on the NEXT one, the way carried cues already work.
 *
 * **And the RANK travels with it, not the vector.** Measured hermetically at the
 * live index's size, `Store.nearestTo` over 13,862 vectors costs 590-1040 ms:
 * `cache.nearest` reads and JSON-parses every row.
 *
 * **Amended 2026-09-05, and the conclusion survives.** Box 3 now stores vectors
 * as float32 BLOBs, and the same scan measures ~50 ms at 14,000×1,024
 * (`store/NOTES.md`) — so the SCAN half of this argument is largely paid off.
 * The other half is not: the network call is still a network call, and it is
 * the one that cannot be raced against a 1200 ms synchronous budget. Ranking
 * stays in the worker for that reason alone.
 *
 * Handing the hot path a vector
 * would have moved the network call off it and left that scan on it — the same
 * abort one layer down. So this file embeds AND ranks, and stores the top-M
 * `{id, score}` slice as per-session gate state (`recall/session.ts`).
 *
 * Both jobs run in the detached worker, both take the injected `fetch` and the
 * watchdog's `AbortSignal`, and neither may fail the run: an embedder that
 * cannot embed costs a cue, never a day.
