/**
 * `doctor` — the one reading that says out loud whether the BACKGROUND half is
 * alive.
 *
 * **The incident this answers (I32, 2026-09-11).** For a week the detached
 * worker was refused at every boundary — `~/.counterparts/credentials.env` had
 * been rewritten to the template by a forced install, so `planSpawn` answered
 * `NO_CREDENTIAL` every time. Every VISIBLE surface read healthy: the wake
 * delivered, recall rendered, capture captured, `verify` was clean, the daily
 * graded the day ACTIVE. Meanwhile the lived-day clock was frozen at 185, no
 * sleep cycle had run since 09-04, every ask was `capped` against a day that
 * never rolled over, and nothing had been embedded. The owner learned it from a
 * session that went looking.
 *
 * #95 made the refusals durable and persisted the escalation counter — the
 * evidence exists now. This module is the READER of that evidence, and it exists
 * once so the console and the session-start notice cannot disagree about what
 * "healthy" means (constitution 16: if the owner can't see it, it isn't
 * trustworthy).
 *
 * Three rules shape it:
 *
 *   1. **It reads and never writes.** Every store call below is a read; the
 *      caller supplies an OBSERVER store or one that is already open. Nothing
 *      here opens a database, mints a directory or touches box 3.
 *   2. **Names and counts, never values.** Paths, names, counts and dates —
 *      never memory text.
 *   3. **It is on the hot path, so it is bounded.** `sessionNoticeBudgetMs`
 *      bounds the whole reading at session start, checked BETWEEN groups; what
 *      the budget cut off is reported as a finding rather than silently
 *      omitted (scar §2.4 — a door that did not open must not look like a door
 *      nobody needed).

 *
 * The `Store` finding reads the DIRECTORY: is there a store here, and is it the
 * one the config names. A store can pass that and still throw at every session
 * start, because opening a counterpart does more than open a database —
 * `Schemas.open` scans every `type: "schema"` row and reads each one's prose
 * file. One missing file, or one row a removal left behind, and every hook in
 * every session stands down: no wake, no recall, no capture, and until now
 * nothing said so while `doctor` printed GREEN Store on the line above.
 *
 * READ BY THE CALLER, like `readCheckout` — and for the same reason it is not
 * taken inside `doctorFindings`, which is pure over its input and never opens
 * anything. The session-start reading does not take it at all: a hook that got
 * as far as composing a notice has ALREADY opened its counterpart, so paying for
 * a second open there would buy a fact it has in hand.

/**
 * THE FIRST DAY THIS STORE CAN EVIDENCE, or null when it can evidence none.
 *
 * The finding (new-user findings #8, 2026-09-21): a seven-day window printed
 * `2026-09-15→2026-09-21` on a store made that morning — a week the store did
 * not exist for. The window is not wrong about what it LOOKED at; it is wrong
 * about what it could have seen, and a reader has no way to tell the two apart.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, and both are the store's own record of ITSELF — never of what is
 * in it. The earliest of them wins, because an over-stated age costs nothing
 * (the window is simply not clamped, which is today's behaviour) while an
 * under-stated one would name a window narrower than the rows it counted:
 *
 *   1. `store.created` — one meta row, written by the open that made the file
 *      (`core/store#STORE_CREATED_KEY`).
 *   2. `store.started` — `start-fresh`'s own record of the day a blank store
 *      took a parked one's place.
 *
 * **Absent on every store made before 2026-09-21** — every store 0.1.0 made,
 * which is why finding #8 stayed open for them after 0.2.0 closed it for new
 * ones. So when neither record is there, the store's own evidence stands in
 * (2026-09-23), and the EARLIER of two readings wins:
 *
 *   3. **The oldest event row's `at`** — the moment a row was WRITTEN, on the
 *      store's own provenance clock, and the smallest one (`eventLogCensus`'s
 *      `MIN(at)`), not the first row by insertion order. Not `rowDate`: that
 *      prefers the payload's `date` field, the day the event is ABOUT.
 *   4. **The database file's birth time.** A filesystem that keeps none reports
 *      zero, or — Node's documentation allows it — the change time instead;
 *      a birth time that is not EARLIER than the change time is therefore read
 *      as "no answer" rather than trusted.
 *
 * **WHICH WAY THESE CAN BE WRONG, said plainly (review of #188, M2): YOUNGER.**
 * Each is the latest day the store could have begun, never the earliest: no
 * row is written before the store exists, and `install` writes no event, so a
 * store installed on the 3rd and first used on the 10th has its oldest row on
 * the 10th; a database restored from a copy is born the day it was copied.
 * Taking the earlier of the two answers the common case — an installed-but-idle
 * store, whose FILE was born on the 3rd — and leaves one: a store that was both
 * copied into place and idle before its first row. Its label then starts later
 * than the store did, and hides days on which nothing was invited — the very
 * silence the Authorship line exists to show. The READING is untouched either
 * way (`windowShown` moves only the words), which is why a label that can err
 * in that one case was judged worth having for every 0.1.0 store rather than
 * no label at all. Event pruning does not add a case: a row goes only at 90
 * lived days, far outside a seven-day window.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE SOURCES AND ARE NOT. A memory's `learned_on` — an
 * imported store carries dates from long before it existed. `livedDay` — the
 * physics clock, which the worker advances and which is 0 on a store whose
 * worker has never run.

/**
 * THE NIGHTLY PAGE WRITER (2026-09-20, S2) — one line: has last night happened,
 * and what did it come to.
 *
 * **GREEN when it has never run on a store younger than a day**, and that is
 * the whole design of this line rather than a leniency. A mechanism that fires
 * once a night cannot have fired on a store installed this morning, and a line
 * that says something is wrong from the moment it lands is a line people learn
 * to read past — the same rule `fired.ts` states for its `blind` rows and the
 * same one `selfPageFindings` follows for an absent page.
 *
 * Green also for a night that read the day and had nothing to say: that is the
 * mechanism working, and it is stated in words rather than left as a silence.
 *
 * Green when it is OFF, too — a deliberate choice is not a fault — with the
 * line saying what off means. (This comment and the adapter CONTRACT used to
 * say "amber while a page stands"; the code has said green since the S2
 * review, and the words now follow the code, 2026-09-28.)
 *
 * AMBER, with a fix, on the readings that mean something has stopped: a run
 * that failed or was refused, a pageWriter block that could not be read, and
 * — since the writer moved into the nightly run (2026-09-28) — a night owed
 * for days while nightly runs went on without it. A night owed because no run
 * started (fewer than three new memories, dreaming off or declined) is the
 * ordinary state of a quiet week and stays green. Never red: nothing here can
 * cost a session its memory.

 * not import each other. What comes in carries the host's own vocabulary —
 * which events were expected, what the server is called — so this file grades
 * and keeps nothing it would have to hold in step.
 *
 * AMBER, NEVER RED, and it always says which files it read: `~/.claude.json` is
 * the host's own state file, documented as one the host writes for itself, so a
 * negative answer here is "I looked at these and did not find it", never "you
