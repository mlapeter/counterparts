/**
 * Detached execution — the "heavy work runs somewhere else" half of scar E4.
 *
 * A hook returns in microseconds. Sleep, the crash-fallback sweep and every
 * model call run in a child this file starts and then forgets about. Four
 * properties, each of them an incident someone lived through:
 *
 *   **E4 — a watchdog, validated.** The child gets a timeout, and the timeout is
 *   checked against `remember/`'s claim-staleness window BEFORE the spawn. A
 *   watchdog that fires after a claim looks stale means two runs can hold the
 *   same spans; `remember.validateWatchdog` is the check, and SEAMS queued item
 *   10 asks for it to be PROVEN here rather than asserted in a comment.
 *
 *   **E4's widening — a worker that cannot start ESCALATES.** v1's runner
 *   starved for two days on a credential it expected to inherit from whatever
 *   shell launched the session, and the backlog drained only when a human
 *   noticed. So: a plan that cannot run says why, by name, and the same failure
 *   repeated crosses an escalation threshold instead of writing the same line
 *   forever. The backlog depth rides along as a reported number.
 *
 *   **§2.13 — the spawner pins the child's environment LAST.** `dataDir` is
 *   written onto the child env after every inherited value, so nothing a caller
 *   exported can redirect a run into the wrong store. v1's replay harness
 *   silently honored a pre-set data-directory variable, which is the observer
 *   scar escalated from training a store to destroying its graph.
 *
 *   **§2.18 — the credential comes from the environment we PIN, not the shell we
 *   inherited.** It travels on the child's environment like everything else here.
 *   It is NOT a precondition of the spawn, and that changed on 2026-09-11 (I32):
 *   for a week this file refused `NO_CREDENTIAL` at every boundary, and because
 *   the worker never started, the lived-day clock never advanced, the sleep
 *   cycle never ran, the Hebbian buffer never flushed and the day's ask cap —
 *   keyed on that frozen clock — stayed spent. A refusal that stops FIVE jobs to
 *   protect ONE of them is not a safety property; it is a single point of
 *   failure with a name. The worker now starts whenever it has a data dir and a
 *   sane watchdog, and the one step that needed the key (`runner.ts`'s sweep)
 *   degraded and SAID SO on a durable row. Nothing about that is a licence to
 *   run blind: the refusals that remain are the ones where starting would be
 *   wrong, not merely unproductive. (Since 2026-09-24 the package reads no key
 *   at all — the sweep's API path went with it.)
 *
 * `planSpawn` is pure and returns a checkable plan; `spawnDetached` is the six
 * lines that actually start a process. The split is deliberate: everything worth
 * testing is in the pure half.
