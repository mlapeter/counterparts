/**
 * ONE DELIVERY PER EVENT, HOWEVER MANY WIRINGS FIRE IT (2026-10-09).
 *
 * Claude Code runs every hook registered for an event — from settings and from
 * plugins alike — at the same moment, each handed the same input. When two
 * wirings of Counterparts are live (the npm install's hooks in settings and
 * the plugin's, or two settings files naming two builds), every event runs our
 * hook twice: two wakes at session start, two recall blocks per prompt, two
 * Stop asks, two boundaries, two background workers rewriting the wake bundle
 * at each other. The plugin is meant to stand down when it sees the npm wiring
 * (`adapters/plugin.ts#hookGate`), and on 2026-10-09 a plugin from an older
 * build did not recognise the newer `connect`'s hook line and didn't. That
 * reading is tolerant now (`host-wiring.ts#readOurHook`), and this is the
 * backstop for the next way it fails: the FIRST hook process to claim the
 * event does the event's whole job, and its twin exits with no output.
 *
 * THE CLAIM is one row of its OWN small database,
 * `sessions/claims/hook-claims.sqlite` (`claimsPath`), changed in one `BEGIN
 * IMMEDIATE` transaction: the second process waits and then reads what the
 * first wrote. The row holds only the claims of the last `CLAIM_WINDOW_MS` (at
 * most `CLAIM_KEEP` of them), so it never grows. Each of the claim's two writes
 * waits at most `CLAIM_WAIT_MS`.
 *
 * ITS OWN FILE, NOT THE STORE'S `meta` (2026-10-10). Until then the row lived in
 * `counterparts.sqlite`, so the claim waited on the store's one write lock, and
 * the store's busiest writer is the detached worker the previous Stop or
 * SessionEnd started: it reaches the store a bun start-up after its hook exits,
 * which is just when the NEXT hook reaches it. On a loaded machine its commits
 * held the lock for 300 to 600 ms at a time, past the claim's 500 ms, and the
 * claim gave up (`database is locked`) where the hook's other writes, which wait
 * five seconds, went through (CI on master a78e1dae; reproduced in a 2-CPU Linux
 * container). In this file the only writers are claims, each well under a
 * millisecond of work, so a claim waits on nothing but another claim, and a
 * store somebody holds costs it nothing at all. The file is host state, not
 * memory: inside `sessions/` (LAYOUT's entry says new state of that kind goes
 * there), never backed up, and nothing in it outlives the window. In a
 * directory of its own, as `log/` and `association/` are, because the sessions
 * prune removes any FILE directly in `sessions/` untouched for a week, and in
 * WAL a commit touches the log, not the database file.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES TWO PROCESSES TWINS — the same KEY, and running AT THE SAME TIME.
 *
 *   - THE KEY is what Claude Code hands every hook of one event identically: the
 *     session id, the event, and `prompt_id` (2.1.296: "UUID correlating a user
 *     prompt with all subsequent events until the next prompt"), with the prompt
 *     text (UserPromptSubmit), `source` (SessionStart), `stop_hook_active` and
 *     the last assistant message (Stop), `reason` (SessionEnd) and `trigger`
 *     (PreCompact) folded in. Text is hashed; the key is a hash, and nothing of
 *     the prompt is stored. The transcript's size is NOT in it: the host may
 *     write between the twins starting, and a key that differs between twins is
 *     no claim at all.
 *   - AT THE SAME TIME: the host starts the twins together, so each began before
 *     the other could have finished. The winner records when its process started
 *     and, as it exits, when it finished; a process with the same key that
 *     STARTED BEFORE THE HOLDER FINISHED (or while it is still running) is its
 *     twin. A process that started after the holder finished is a separate event
 *     that happens to look the same — a host with no `prompt_id` sending the same
 *     words twice, a session resumed twice in a row — and it delivers. So the
 *     time a hook takes or the store's busy timeout cannot turn a twin into a
 *     second delivery, and no repeat is ever swallowed by a clock. A slow
 *     START-UP can, and did (2026-10-10, measured under load: a twin's runtime
 *     came up 45 ms after the winner finished, and the session got two wakes).
 *     So an event the host sends ONCE per key (`firesOnce`: a session's first
 *     start, a prompt with its id) is a twin whenever it started; the rest keep
 *     the start-time rule, and there the claim is a backstop that a very late
 *     twin can still pass.
 *   - A holder that never says it finished (killed, crashed) holds for
 *     `CLAIM_WINDOW_MS` and no longer.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS. No session id, an observer, a claims file that will not
 * take the write: this process delivers. Two deliveries are a nuisance; none is
 * a session that woke up with no memory. A single wiring therefore behaves
 * exactly as before, at the cost of two small writes per event.
 *
 * A CLAIMS FILE THAT IS NOT A DATABASE IS SET ASIDE AND REBUILT, ONCE (review of
 * #359, 2026-10-10). Before, a corrupt or foreign file was a lasting fault: a
 * stderr line on every event, and the backstop off until somebody deleted it.
 * Now the write that meets one (`isUnreadableDatabase`) moves it — with its
 * `-wal` and `-shm`, so a stale log is never replayed into the new file — to
 * `hook-claims.unreadable-<epoch ms>.sqlite` beside it, keeping only the newest
 * such copy, and tries once more on a fresh file. The copy is the durable trace:
 * doctor's `Hook claims` line reads it (`claimsSetAside`). Nothing in the file
 * outlives the window, so nothing is lost but the claims of the last 15 s. The
 * event is delivered whatever happens.
 *
 * PRIVATE, AS `log/` IS: the directory is made 0700 and the file 0600 (SQLite
 * gives its `-wal` and `-shm` the database file's mode).
 *
 * WHY ONE WIRING CLAIMS TOO. A hook cannot know it has no twin: the claim is the
 * backstop for exactly the case where reading the host's wiring got it wrong
 * (2026-10-09), so it cannot be skipped on that same reading. What one wiring
 * pays is the two small writes, on a file nothing else writes.
