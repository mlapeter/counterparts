/**
 * The embedder this host opens — the local STATIC table (potion-base-8M,
 * `core/embed/static.ts`), computed in-process: no key, no network, nothing
 * leaves the machine.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-24 this file also held a paid remote seat (Voyage) and its HTTP
 * client — the chunked, bisecting, per-chunk-isolated batch call that I33 was
 * fought over. The owner removed it with the other API key (keyless only), so
 * the static tier is the only embedder there is. What the paid seat taught
 * stays where it belongs: the store's embedder IDENTITY TAG
 * (`cache_meta.embedder`, `<model>@<dim>`) still means a store whose vectors
 * came from another model is never ranked against this one's, and the
 * backfill's give-up counter still retires a text the table cannot embed.
 *
 * `LiveEmbedder` stays the seam every composition root wires — the store's
 * sync `embed` and the novelty/recall `vectors` socket — so a test can still
 * inject its own.
