/**
 * WHY A HOOK STOOD DOWN, IN WORDS, AND WHETHER THE OWNER SHOULD HEAR IT.
 *
 * **The gap this closes (H1, 2026-09-18).** `bin/hook.ts` has always ended a
 * failed run with one line on stderr and exit 0 — "a failed hook is a quiet
 * hook, never a failed session". The principle is right; the quiet is the
 * problem. A hook's stderr goes nowhere the owner looks, and three reviews in
 * one day hit the same wall: a fully-removed belief left a row that made
 * `Counterpart.open` throw at every session start; a missing prose file on any
 * schema row still does; a config typo that stood the adapter down was equally
 * invisible. No wake, no recall, no capture, every session — and every visible
 * surface green. The constitution's own sentence: silence must never masquerade
 * as health.
 *
 * So a stand-down is now one of two things, and this file is where they are told
 * apart:
 *
 *   - **DELIBERATE** — a directory scoped `off`, an observer with no store to
 *     read, the explicit-dir guard refusing a store nobody named. Nothing is
 *     wrong; the stand-down IS the behaviour. Quiet, exactly as before.
 *   - **A FAULT** — the store would not open, the named configuration could not
 *     be honoured. Something the owner has to fix, and until he does he has no
 *     memory. Said out loud, on the two events the host displays a
 *     `systemMessage` on (`bin/hook.ts#standDown`).
 *
 * It sits beside `doctor.ts` rather than under `bin/` because both read it: the
 * console's `Store open` finding asks the same question the hook's catch asks —
 * "would this store open the way a session opens it, and if not, in what words?"
 * — and two vocabularies for one question is how the terminal and the console
 * come to disagree about what "healthy" means (constitution 16).
