 * shapes are gone. A `claude-code.json` that still carries `stopAskShape` is
 * read fine, the key ignored and named among the old settings (`config.ts`).
 *
 * What the person sees is NOT only their own line: the host's 2.1.281 bundle
 * renders an additionalContext on Stop under "Ran 1 stop hook" as

 * boundaries in all four, while its authored deposits and their coverage marks
 * landed in ONE — because the MCP server's scope is fixed at launch and a
 * deposit only covers spans in its own scope. Everything the session wrote in
 * the other three was left uncovered, to be rewritten twelve hours later by the
 * crash fallback as though the session had died. Two worktree scopes on that
 * store hold 298 fallback memories and zero authored ones.
 *
 * **Two sources, in this order, and they agree by construction.**
 *
 *   1. **The session registry's own record** (`adapters/sessions.ts`), which
 *      SessionStart wrote and which `recordSession` refuses to rewrite after a
 *      start. It is the recorded fact of where this session began, and it is the
 *      SAME string `mcp/server.ts#requireBoundSession` matches a deposit
 *      against — so a scope taken from here cannot disagree with the server that
 *      claims coverage.
 *   2. **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, then the payload's `cwd`, then `process.cwd()`**,
 *      for the first event of a session and for a session whose record was
 *      pruned. The host documents `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` as the project root where
 *      the session started, exports it to hook processes AND to stdio MCP
 *      servers, and keeps it put when the agent enters a worktree or runs `cd` —
 *      which is exactly the property the payload's `cwd` lacks. `serve.ts` reads
 *      the same variable in the same position, which is what makes the two sides
 *      agree without either one telling the other.
 *
 * Canonical on both sides (`canonicalScope`): the record stores a realpath, so a
 * scope read back from it and one resolved fresh have to be the same string or
 * the session would split on `/tmp` versus `/private/tmp` alone — and span
 * directories are keyed by a hash of this exact string (`remember/spans.ts`).

/**
 * How each hook's output reaches the model on THIS host — measured, not

 *
 *   - SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit: plain stdout with exit 0 is added to the
 *     model's context. The wake (8,859 B) arrived that way.
 *   - Stop: plain stdout with exit 0 reaches NOBODY. An ask written that way
 *     was recorded (`adapter.episode.ask asked:true`) and never seen. The one
 *     channel proven on this host is the blocking one bansai has used all along:
 *     the text on STDERR and exit code 2, which the host feeds back to the model
 *     as "Stop hook feedback" and lets it continue. The host then re-fires Stop
 *     with `stop_hook_active: true`; that re-fire must ask NOTHING or the ask
 *     loops forever (v1's anti-loop, kept here for the same reason).
 *     **Since 2026-09-24 the ask leaves by the host's documented NON-ERROR
 *     route instead** (`HOST_STOP` above): exit 0, the model's ask as
 *     `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, one line for the person as
 *     `systemMessage`. Same continuation, same re-fire, same refusal of it.
 *
 * **The fourth channel, added 2026-09-14 for I32: `systemMessage`.** Documented
 * at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (formerly
 * docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) and measured by the owner's own
 * probe on 2026-09-11: a SessionStart hook that exits 0 and prints JSON with a
 * top-level `systemMessage` gets that text DISPLAYED in the terminal
 * (`SessionStart:startup says: …`), non-blocking, while `additionalContext` and
 * stderr do not show. The doc also states the rule that makes this safe or
 * dangerous depending on which form you print: **when stdout parses as JSON the
 * raw stdout is NOT also added to context** — only the JSON's fields are. So the
 * wake must ride ENTIRELY in `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, byte for
 * byte what plain stdout would have carried, and a day with nothing red prints
 * the plain form it has printed since day 0 rather than a JSON wrapper nobody
 * has measured on this host.
 *
 * Pure, so the test proves the channel choice without a process. `dropped` is
 * how a pure function reports the one thing it cannot do itself: the caller
 * turns it into the ring row that makes a silent terminal explicable.
