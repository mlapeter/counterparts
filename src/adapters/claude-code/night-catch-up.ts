/**
 * THE MORNING CATCH-UP (2026-10-01, build 3) — the nightly run writes up owed
 * stretches, in ANY directory, before its page writer runs.
 *
 * Until now an owed stretch was written up only by the next session opened in
 * the same directory (the SessionStart pointer, two a day store-wide), so a
 * project nobody reopened within two days of use simply lapsed. The nightly run
 * already starts at the first prompt of the day, headless; this is a short
 * phase in front of it.
 *
 * **A runner of its own.** The main child is bound to the session that started
 * the night (#282's choice), and that session's record is a live session's —
 * its own write-up pointer and fetched part live there. So the catch-up gets a
 * session id of its own, `writeup-<run>` (`sessions.ts#NIGHT_RUNNER_PREFIX`),
 * and its own `claude -p` child, pinned to it, allowed one tool:
 * `session_end`. The LAUNCHER (this file, in `bin/nightly.ts`'s process) writes
 * the grant onto the runner's record (`sessions.ts#grantWriteUps`) — never a
 * model — and the MCP door (`mcp/write-up.ts`) serves only what is listed
 * there, ended (the ledger's word) and owed, and files the memories under the
 * subject's own directory.
 *
 * **Claim-first.** The launcher claims every subject it grants before the child
 * starts (`WriteUpProgress.claim`), so the SessionStart pointer passes them over
 * and a session that tries to fetch one is told the nightly run has it; a
 * subject another writer already holds is not granted. The claims are let go
 * when the child ends, whatever became of it.
 *
 * **Bounded** by `TUNABLES.NIGHT_WRITE_UP_SESSIONS` and `NIGHT_WRITE_UP_BYTES`,
 * oldest stretch first (it lapses first). The bound rides on each claim as
 * `upTo`, the last part the door will serve tonight. What it left — and what
 * the run wrote — is one durable row (`NIGHT_WRITE_UP_EVENT`), and a line in
 * the process log.
 *
 * Proved against an injected starter and a stub executable only, like the
 * night itself.
