/**
 * `identity` — the identity band and the protected set, SIDE BY SIDE.
 *
 * The keep (CONTRACT §3, review finding 2; scar §2.19): *inspectability scales
 * with permanence.* Everything permanent is enumerable on demand — a list, not a
 * cadence — and this view is the demand.
 *
 * The two lists are different populations and the difference is the whole point
 * (`self/identity.ts` says it best): identity is what strength EARNED and physics
 * can still move; protected is permanent ink no revision path reaches and no
 * schema slice will ever contradict. "Permanent-includes-permanently-wrong" is
 * doctrine, so a protected element that is NOT in the identity band — permanence
 * without the band — is the row most worth staring at, and it gets its own line.
 *
 * The enumeration itself is `self/`'s, not a second implementation. Reads there
 * are pure: they write nothing and log nothing (§14.1 G8).

 * throw), which is right for a briefing and wrong for an inspection surface:
 * scar §2.19 says everything permanent is enumerable ON DEMAND, and a row that
 * quietly stops being counted is indistinguishable from one that was never
 * there. The band is queryable, so the gap is recoverable here — the difference
 * between the band's rows and the enumeration's is printed as named absences.
 *
 * The protected SET has no such recovery: protection is a physics flag on a row
 * whose physics is exactly what stopped reading, so a removed protected element
 * simply leaves the list. Filed in `INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §3.
