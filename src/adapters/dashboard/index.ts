/**
 * `adapters/dashboard/` — the owner's window.
 *
 * The direct instrument of constitution line 16: *if the owner can't see it, it
 * isn't trustworthy.* Five views, minimal-first (Amendment 15, CONTRACT §4):
 *
 *   `status`    the brain at a glance — counts by kind and band, the clock, what
 *               the last cycle finished, what has left and how.
 *   `browse`    the memories, listed by strength; one memory opened shows its
 *               prose PATH and resolves every id it points at, at render time.
 *   `stories`   per contested belief, the durable pressure log told as a story:
 *               lived day, challenger, force, bar, verdict.
 *   `identity`  the identity band and the protected set, side by side, enumerable
 *               on demand (scar §2.19).
 *   `activity`  the recent event feed, content-by-reference resolved at render.
 *
 * ## Observer BY CONSTRUCTION
 *
 * `Dashboard.open` composes a `Counterpart` — the composition root, never a
 * hand-rewired Store, because re-deriving the wiring is how a caller "forgets the
 * map and silently loses the safety half that rides along with it" — and it sets
 * `observer: true` ITSELF. The caller cannot turn it off: an `observer: false` in
 * the options is overwritten, not honoured. `sourceOf()` then refuses any
 * Counterpart whose stance is not observer, so the views cannot be handed a
 * writable brain even by a caller composing them directly.
 *
 * That is two layers. The third and load-bearing one is in the test: it scans
 * every source file in this directory with comments and string literals stripped
 * and fails on any call to a `WRITE_METHODS` name or any filesystem write. That
 * scan is what "holds no write handle" actually means here, and it is also the
 * mechanization of "no memory body text is persisted into dashboard state" — the
 * dashboard has no state file because it cannot open one.
 *
 * `budgetBytes` and `identity` are deliberately never passed through: the
 * dashboard does not wake and does not mint an identity core. An instrument
 * leaves the store as it found it (scar E7).
 *
 * ## Terminal-first
 *
 * CONTRACT OQ1 asked terminal or local web. Terminal, for now — see `NOTES.md`;
 * it is a working default, revisable without ceremony, and nothing in the view
 * functions knows it: they return strings.
