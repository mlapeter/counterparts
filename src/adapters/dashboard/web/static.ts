/**
 * Which URL paths are the page's own static files, and where each one lives.
 *
 * A pure function of the path — no filesystem here; `server.ts` does the one
 * `readFileSync`. The page is split into plain browser ES modules and
 * stylesheets under `web/` (see `web/README.md`), and this is the whole of what
 * the server will hand out from that tree:
 *
 *   - only `/app.js`, and files under `/shared/`, `/shell/`, `/pages/` and
 *     `/mechanisms/` — so `server.ts`, `views.ts`, the view modules and the two
 *     HTML files are NOT reachable as files (the HTML has its own routes);
 *   - only an allow-listed extension: `.js`, `.css`, `.woff2`;
 *   - every path segment plain (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` plus inner dots): no `..`, no
 *     `.`, no empty segment, no dotfile, no backslash, no NUL, no `%` left
 *     after ONE decode (so a double-encoded `%252e%252e` is refused, not
 *     decoded twice);
 *   - and the joined path must still sit under `web/`, checked after the join,
 *     as the last belt.
 *
 * Symlinks are not followed-and-checked: that would need `realpathSync`, and
 * `server.ts`'s filesystem surface is pinned to `readFileSync` alone. The tree
 * is the install's own files; `test/dashboard-web.test.ts` asserts it holds no
 * symlink at all.
