/**
 * One rule, in one place: **the web views withhold a confidential memory exactly
 * the way every other surface withholds it.**
 *
 * `recall/activate.ts#isConfidential` is the predicate the surfacing gate uses;
 * a dashboard that resolved the same id straight to its first line would be the
 * one screen in the system where the rule does not hold — and it would be the
 * screen that gets screenshotted. So every id that becomes text on a web page
 * goes through `reveal()` rather than through `resolveRef` directly, and a
 * confidential row comes back as a NAMED withholding: its id, its physics, its
 * band, its place in the constellation, all still visible — only the words gone.
 *
 * That distinction is the point. Withholding the text is not hiding the memory:
 * a memory the owner cannot see the EXISTENCE of would be worse than one whose
 * sentence is on screen (constitution line 16). The label says which it is.
 *
 * Render-time, like everything else here (CONTRACT §3, scar §2.20): nothing
 * below caches, and a memory made confidential after a page loaded stops
 * resolving on the next request.
