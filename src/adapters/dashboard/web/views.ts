/**
 * The web dashboard's JSON views — the same read surface the terminal views use
 * (`DashboardSource`), shaped for a page instead of for a column of text.
 *
 * Four rules travel from the terminal adapter unchanged, and they are the reason
 * this file exists rather than a handful of ad-hoc handlers in the server:
 *
 *   1. **Render-time id resolution, everywhere.** Nothing below emits text that
 *      was stored beside an id. Every id becomes words at the moment the request
 *      is served, through `reveal()` — so a removed memory reads as removed in a
 *      panel built from a three-day-old event (scar §2.20).
 *   2. **Confidential rows are withheld the way every other surface withholds
 *      them** (`reveal.ts`). The row stays visible — id, band, strength, its dot
 *      in the constellation — and only the sentence is gone. A memory the owner
 *      cannot see the existence of would be the worse failure.
 *   3. **Absence has two words.** `(none yet)` — asked, and the answer is zero.
 *      `(never run)` — never asked. Every panel says which; none is blank
 *      (scar §2.4, `NOTES.md`).
 *   4. **Totality.** Kinds, bands, cycle phases and durable event names come
 *      from `registries.ts`, which derives them from the live core. A member
 *      with nothing to report is a row that says so.
 *
 * The journal is excluded from every memory census here, exactly as `status.ts`
 * and `browse.ts` exclude it: an episode is the SOURCE a memory was made from,
 * it sits outside every sleep phase, and counting it would make the census wrong
 * by the number of days lived.
 */
/*
 * This file is now the INDEX of `web/views/`: one module per view (and the
 * shared census and row builders beside them), every public name re-exported
 * here unchanged, so `server.ts` and the tests import exactly what they always
 * did. The four rules above hold for every file in that folder.
