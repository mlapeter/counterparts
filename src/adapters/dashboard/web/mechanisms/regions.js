/* The brain's regions and which mechanisms happen where — the site's mapping
   (counterparts-site features/home-v2/content/regions.ts), with the two parked
   mechanisms (identity, storage) left out, as the site leaves them out of its
   pills. The home page's brain is drawn from this table; clicking a region
   picks its first mechanism, and clicking it again steps to the next.

   `col` is rgb 0..1 as the shader wants it; `anchor` is where the region's
   point sits in the model's space. The cerebellum is drawn for anatomy and has
   nothing to click. */
