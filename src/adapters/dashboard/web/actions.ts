/**
 * THE MANAGEMENT SEAM — what the owner does on purpose from the dashboard
 * (owner, 2026-09-25; CONTRACT §5, `docs/observer-mode.md` §1).
 *
 * Looking and managing are kept apart by WHICH DOOR a request goes through, not
 * by a mode:
 *
 *   - **Looking** is `server.ts#router` over the observer source, and nothing
 *     in this file can reach that source: no function here takes a
 *     `DashboardSource`, a `Dashboard` or a `Store`. It is handed the store's
 *     DIRECTORY and the configuration's PATH — two strings, exactly what a
 *     person types after `--dir` and `--config`.
 *   - **Managing** is the console's own `run()` — the function
 *     `bin/counterparts.ts` calls — with an argv array built here from
 *     validated fields. Every check, refusal and sentence is the CLI's; this
 *     file adds guards in front of it and never a way around one.
 *
 * ## Why in-process, and not a child process
 *
 * A child process running `bin/counterparts.ts` would be the most literal
 * reading of "the CLI's own door", and it CANNOT REMOVE: `remove --confirm`
 * asks the person to type the id back through `io.prompt`, the bin binds a
 * prompt only when stdin is a terminal, and a pipe gets "refused: removal
 * requires an interactive confirmation" — deliberately, with no `--yes`.
 * In-process, the prompt is a seam `run()` already has (`Io.prompt`): the
 * browser asks the owner to type the id, and the string they typed is what the
 * CLI's own prompt receives, so the CLI's own comparison is what refuses a
 * mismatch. `io.tty` is left absent, so `isInteractive` is false and removal
 * takes the scripted door (`--confirm`) exactly as a script would.
 *
 * What that costs, said plainly: a command running in this process cannot be
 * killed. The timeout below stops WAITING and says so; the command finishes in
 * the background, and the queue holds every other action until it has.
 *
 * The CLI module is imported LAZILY, on the first action, so a dashboard that
 * is only looked at never loads a line of code that can write.
 *
 * ## Which commands
 *
 * `note`, `remove`, `backup`, `export`, `scope`, `rebrief`, `verify`, and the
 * read-only `ask` and `doctor` (the health tab's checklist: `doctor --json`,
 * the console's own reading, so the page and the terminal cannot disagree
 * about what "healthy" means). `install`, `uninstall` and `start-fresh` stay terminal-only
 * (owner, 2026-09-25) — they are not in `ACTIONS`, so no argv for them can be
 * built here.
