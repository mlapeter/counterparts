/**
 * The narration vocabulary: every durable event name, as one sentence in the
 * brain's own voice, naming the SPECIFIC memory.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to keep comes from v1's dashboard batch, where the
 * owner's verdict on the first narration draft was that it was "so generic it's
 * not helpful at all": "a memory was reinforced" is a mechanism statement, and
 * a mechanism statement is a legend, not a feed. What a feed owes the owner is
 * *which* memory, *which* day, *which* number — and the mechanism by which that
 * is possible without ever putting text in the log is render-time id
 * resolution: the event carries `mem_…`, this file resolves it at the moment of
 * printing, and a memory the owner removed this morning reads as removed in a
 * line written three days ago.
 *
 * ## Tone is a payload judgement, never a name judgement
 *
 * Amber is reserved for "look at this": a refusal, a quarantine, a cap. It is
 * NOT for ordinary aging — `decay`-side band moves and prunes are calm, because
 * forgetting is the thesis, not a fault (constitution line 3; v1's flow-walk
 * item 4 is the same call made once already). So the tone of a line is decided
 * by reading the payload — a `sweep.gate` that quarantined spans is amber, one
 * that swept nothing is calm — and two events with the same name can carry
 * different tones on the same page.
 *
 * ## Totality
 *
 * `NARRATORS` is `satisfies Record<DurableEventName, Teller>`, so a durable
 * event added to the core fails `tsc` here until it has a sentence. A feed that
 * silently printed a raw name for the one new thing the system learned to
 * record is exactly the starvation this project's registries exist to prevent
 * (scar §2.17), and `test/dashboard-web.test.ts` asserts the same property at
 * runtime for anyone reading the test instead of the type.
