  //
  // "Has anything happened" was asked of the event log alone, and the event log
  // is not the whole truth: a deposit that writes no durable event never moves
  // `lastSeq`, so the refetch never fired and a page left open on the flow tab
  // said `143 came through` forever while the server already answered 144.
  // `/api/meta` carries a row count for exactly this — one cheap request beside
  // the one we were already making.
  //
  // The example was `counterparts note`, and it is no longer one: since
  // `gate.deposit` (2026-09-05) the authored door writes a row like every other
  // door, so a note moves the sequence and lands in the branch below. This stays
  // as the belt — a store seeded around the door, and any future writer that
  // leaves no row — because a freshness check that is only correct while one
  // particular writer happens to log is not a freshness check.

/**

 *
 * THE FLOW PAGE WAS NOT THE ONLY PAGE COUNTING. The first fix for the stale
 * `143 came through` refreshed the flow diagram and stopped there, so the
 * OVERVIEW — the page the dashboard opens on, the one in the README's first
 * image — kept its boot-time tiles: `memories held`, `lived days`, the band
 * bars, the identity panel, all frozen at whatever they were when the tab was
 * opened, while the flow tab beside it moved. Same bug, one page over. Every
 * page with a `refresh` (overview, then flow) is re-read here, in nav order,
 * from the one signal that catches a deposit with no durable event of its own.
