/**
 * The flow page's map: COUNTERPARTS' own architecture as a diagram, and the
 * rule that every durable event has a place on it.
 *
 * Three things live here and nowhere else:
 *
 *   1. **The nodes** — one per module (plus the two seams a reader can see: the
 *      session the host holds, and the crash-fallback sweep). Each carries what
 *      it does in plain language and its BRAIN ANALOG, quoted in substance from
 *      the module's own `CONTRACT.md` §2 — including where the analogy
 *      deliberately breaks, because a comparison that only says where it holds
 *      is advertising (constitution line 12: deviations are named).
 *   2. **The edges** — the pipeline, drawn once. `dotted` marks the path that is
 *      supposed to be silent: the crash fallback (`remember/fallback.ts`).
 *   3. **The event→node map**, with a TOTALITY rule of exactly the kind
 *      `registries.ts` keeps for the axes: `EVENT_NODE` is declared
 *      `satisfies Record<DurableEventName, NodeKey>`, so a durable event added
 *      to the core fails `tsc` HERE until someone decides which part of the
 *      machine it belongs to. A particle with nowhere to land would otherwise
 *      just never be drawn, which is the silent-starvation failure again
 *      (scar §2.17).
 *
 * Geometry lives here too — normalized 0..1 coordinates — so the page is a dumb
 * renderer and the diagram's shape is reviewable as data.

 * `143 memories held` on the same diagram — a flat contradiction to anyone who
 * did not click it. The gate battery HAD run, on all 143; it simply wrote a
 * durable record on one of its two paths. The crash-sweep path recorded what it
 * gated because nobody watched it happen; the authored path was gated in line,
 * in front of the person who asked, and wrote nothing durable.
 *
 * **That is no longer true, and this entry went away with it (2026-09-05).**
 * `gate.deposit` is the authored door's own row — the same battery, the same
 * content-by-reference rules, one row per deposit that reached it — so both of
 * encode's paths are in the log and the node has an ordinary count to show.
 * Replay §2a, which named this as the place it would change, is closed.
 *
 * The map stays because the WORD is still needed: a node whose work is real but
 * deliberately unrecorded must say so in its own words rather than borrow an
 * absence word that means something else. Keyed separately from
 * `NO_EVENT_OF_ITS_OWN` for the same reason as before — a node with an event
