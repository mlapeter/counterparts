    why: "There is no durable per-cycle outcome record — the report goes back to its caller and is gone. What survives is each phase's completion marker and each row's archived-with-reason state, so every exit count on this page is SINCE BIRTH, never 'this cycle'.",

    what: "A protected element I can no longer read.",
    why: "Protection is a flag on the row whose physics stopped reading, so a removed protected element simply leaves the list. The identity band is queryable and that half is recovered above; this half is not (INTERFACE-GAPS §3).",

    what: "Anything older than the retention window.",
    why: "The event log is bounded telemetry, not canonical memory. Rows past the window are swept unless a replay latch holds them, so every count on this page is 'what I still have', not 'what ever happened'.",

    what: "Anything a host did not tell me.",
