/**
 * `/api/mechanisms` — the eleven memory mechanisms the site names, each with a
 * light:
 *
 *   - grey: not built;
 *   - green: built, and fired in the last 7 LIVED days;
 *   - waiting: built, and not due — a scheduled phase that ran on time and
 *     comes round again in N days, or a mechanism holding nothing to act on;
 *   - amber: built, and quiet when it should not be.
 *
 * The list, its order and its four families are the site's
 * (`counterparts-site/features/home-v2/content/regions.ts`, minus the two it
 * parks). WHICH ROWS COUNT AS A FIRING, and how much of each is built, is
 * `adapters/mechanism-evidence.ts` — shared with `counterparts mechanisms`, so
 * the two cannot judge a mechanism differently. This file owns only the window
 * (lived days) and the dashboard's words. What each one says about Counterparts
 * lives beside the page, in `web/mechanisms/<id>/index.js`.
 *
 * Read-only, like everything in this directory. Rules 1–4 of `views.ts` apply;
 * no row text is emitted, only counts and event `seq`s the page can open with
 * `/api/event`.
