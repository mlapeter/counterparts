/**
 * Render-time id resolution — the keep this adapter would be dishonest without
 * (CONTRACT §3, scar §2.20; v1's dashboard batch).
 *
 * The rule: **nothing printed here is text that was stored alongside an id.**
 * Every id the dashboard shows goes through `resolveRef` at the moment of
 * rendering, and what comes back is either the CURRENT text at that address or a
 * NAMED absence. So an owner-removed memory stops appearing the instant it is
 * removed, a superseded belief prints what it became rather than what it said,
 * and a dangling pointer says it is dangling instead of quietly showing the last
 * thing anyone happened to cache.
 *
 * Every path is read-only and every failure is a value, never a throw: this runs
 * in an instrument, and an instrument that crashes on a broken store is the one
 * moment the owner most needs it to render (`observer-mode.md`, scar E7).
