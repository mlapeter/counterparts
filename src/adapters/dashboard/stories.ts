/**
 * `stories` — how a belief changed its mind, told as a story.
 *
 * The keep (CONTRACT §3, review finding 1): the challenge-pressure log rendered
 * as a watchable narrative per contested belief. v1 had the arithmetic and lost
 * the explanation — the pressure NUMBER survived a restart while the story of how
 * it got there did not, which is why `schemas/` now appends every credited
 * increment to box 2's durable `events` table (SEAMS item K). This view is that
 * table, read back.
 *
 * Five things per challenge, exactly as the task states them: **lived day,
 * challenger, force, bar, verdict.**
 *
 * The verdict is DERIVED, not looked up, because there is no durable verdict
 * event — `revision.pressure` is the only event name anything in the core
 * appends today. The derivation is the same arithmetic physics used at the time:
 * `pressureAfter >= bar` is a crossing, and a crossing is a revision. When the
 * lineage confirms it, the successor is resolved at render time and printed, so
 * the story ends in what the belief BECAME rather than in a number.
 *
 * Grouping is by resolved head: a chain challenged at two generations is ONE
 * story about one belief, not two stories about two ids.
