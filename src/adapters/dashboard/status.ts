/**
 * `status` — the brain at a glance, in the brain's own voice.
 *
 * This is the view the totality guarantee is really about (CONTRACT §3/§5 [M]).
 * Three registries are enumerated here and every member of each gets a line:
 * every KIND physics knows, every BAND, every PHASE of the cycle. A member with
 * nothing to report prints an absence marker rather than vanishing, because a
 * vanished row reads as "quiet" and quiet is how v1's starved curation path hid
 * for months (scar §2.17).
 *
 * Narration is first person and plain (CONTRACT §3, "narration in the system's
 * own voice") — the owner's fastest read is a sentence, not a legend.
 *
 * One honesty constraint shapes the cycle block. There is no durable per-cycle
 * outcome record: `CycleReport` is returned to its caller and then gone, and the
 * promotion / prune / merge records live under meta keys nothing can enumerate
 * (`INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §2). What IS durable is each phase's completion marker and
 * each row's archived-with-reason state. So the phase table carries the per-cycle
 * truth — *which lived day did this last finish* — and the exit counts are
 * labelled SINCE BIRTH. A number invented to look like "last cycle" would be scar
 * §2.17 committed by the very view that exists to prevent it.
