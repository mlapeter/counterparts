/**
 * `activity` — what has happened lately, resolved at render.
 *
 * The event log is content-BY-REFERENCE by law (store §5 G10): ids, hashes,
 * counts, scores, kinds, tiers — never body text, never a user turn. That law is
 * what keeps the log from becoming the verbatim honeypot the design rejects, and
 * it is exactly what makes this view necessary: a feed of raw rows is a wall of
 * hex. So every id in a row — its `ref`, and every id-shaped value inside its
 * payload — is resolved HERE, at the moment of printing (scar §2.20).
 *
 * Which means the feed tells the truth as of now: a memory the owner removed
 * this morning reads as removed in a line written three days ago, because the
 * line never held its text.
 *
 * The feed is honest about its own bounds. Events are bounded-retention
 * telemetry, not canonical memory — `pruneEvents` sweeps them past H lived days,
 * keeping only the ones latched by a `dedupKey`. A feed that showed six rows
 * without saying that would be quietly claiming six things ever happened.
