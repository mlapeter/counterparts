/**
 * Did a memory mechanism fire, and which rows say so — the ONE judgement the
 * dashboard's lights (`dashboard/web/views/mechanisms.ts`) and the console's
 * short view (`cli/mechanisms.ts`) both call.
 *
 * **Why it exists** (2026-09-26, an experiment). The two surfaces kept their
 * own rules and disagreed on five of the eleven: the console called a bare
 * sleep-cycle row consolidation AND forgetting, counted a deposit row that
 * accepted nothing as salience, and a flush that wrote no link as association.
 * Now the rules are here, once. Each surface keeps its own table of WORDS and
 * its own window (lived days on the dashboard, calendar days in the console),
 * and both hand the window in.
 *
 * **Where it sits.** Beside `fired.ts`, for the reason that file gives: two
 * adapters need it and adapters never import each other. It imports
 * `dashboard/registries.ts` for the same reason `fired.ts` does — a registry,
 * not a view — and nothing else of the dashboard's, so the console loads no
 * dashboard code.
 *
 * **Built / partly / not** is `build` below, one table: the pills' tags and the
 * home page's "N of 11 built" read it. The calls are from
 * `docs/research/mechanism-audit-2026-09-24.md` plus what shipped since (emotion
 * part A, prospective reminders, the entity-card fade). A working default,
 * revisable.
 *
 * Read-only: `eventLog`, two counts and one meta read. No row text.
