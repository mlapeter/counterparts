/**
 * The daily rotating snapshot — and the only mechanism in this package that
 * DELETES a copy of the owner's memory.
 *
 * **Why it is here and not in the core.** The store exports no delete of any
 * kind (store CONTRACT §5 G2), and rotation is a delete. So the deciding — is
 * today's copy already made, how many are kept, which ones go — lives in an
 * adapter, where a person can read the whole rule in one file.
 *
 * **What it copies is not decided here.** It calls `cli/snapshot.ts#snapshot`
 * unchanged, which copies exactly `Store.backupSet()`. That matters more than it
 * looks: v1 hand-maintained a second allowlist, it landed hours before the
 * episode directory existed, and the canonical journal was silently absent from
 * every backup for three weeks (scar §2.11). A database-only snapshot here would
 * re-enact that on today's floor, where the prose files are canonical.
 *
 * **THE TWO THINGS THAT CAN HURT SOMEONE**, and the shape of each defence:
 *
 *   1. *Rotation deletes.* It deletes only directories sitting DIRECTLY inside
 *      the resolved snapshots directory whose names match the one pattern this
 *      module writes (`snapshotName`); it reads the directory with `Dirent`s, so
 *      a symlink is never followed out; it refuses the whole rotation if that
 *      directory resolves inside the store, contains the store, is a filesystem
 *      root or is the home directory itself; it never deletes the copy just
 *      taken; it never rotates at all after a copy that FAILED — losing the
 *      oldest good backup on the day you could not make a new one is the worst
 *      outcome available here; and a `keep` that is not a positive integer falls
 *      back to the default rather than meaning "delete everything". The copies
 *      the store takes before a schema migration (`PRE_MIGRATION_NAME_RE`) sit
 *      in the same directory on a rule of their own (`expiredPreMigration`).
 *
 *   2. *A half-copy must never count as a snapshot.* The worker runs under a
 *      watchdog and the copy is synchronous, so the process can be killed
 *      mid-copy with no chance to clean up. Every copy is therefore written to a
 *      `.partial-…` name inside the snapshots directory and RENAMED into place
 *      when it completes — one atomic step. An interrupted copy is not counted
 *      toward `keep`, does not satisfy "today's exists", is never a rotation
 *      candidate (its name does not match), and is swept up by a later run once
 *      it is old enough that no live run could still be writing it.
 *
 * **It never throws** (cli CONTRACT §5 G8, and the worker's degrade-don't-abort
 * rule): a snapshot problem must not take a consolidation cycle down. Every
 * failure is a field in the report and, where it is worth a durable record, a
 * `snapshot.failed` row.
 *
 * **Which skips leave a row, and which do not.** A row at every session boundary
 * is a flood, not a record, so: `already-today` writes nothing — today's
 * `snapshot.taken` row IS the record; `attempts-exhausted` writes nothing — the
 * `snapshot.failed` rows it counted are; `no-default-dir` writes nothing,
 * because it is a configuration fact rather than an event and doctor says it in
 * words. Everything that stopped a copy that should have happened — a refused
 * directory, a failed copy, a failed rename, an aborted run — is a
 * `snapshot.failed` row carrying its `reason` and the `step` it died at.
