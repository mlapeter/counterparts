/**
 * The MCP server: messages in, tool results out, one brain underneath.
 *
 * **It composes, it does not re-wire** (CLAUDE.md, `counterpart.ts`'s header).
 * Every durable thing this file does goes through a `Counterpart` method —
 * `captureJot`, `submitJot`, `submitSessionEnd` — so the gate battery, the
 * engine-set authorship channel, the `updates:` resolution and the observer
 * stand-down all ride along without this adapter knowing they exist. The MCP
 * tools are therefore two more entrances on `claude-code/INTERFACE-GAPS.md`
 * §4's table, and they inherit its coverage rather than needing their own.
 *
 * **The three refusals that live HERE**, because no core module can know them:
 *
 *   1. **The bound session.** `session_end` is the return channel for ONE
 *      session's Stop ask (`claude-code/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7). `chapter` binds
 *      by the same rules, through the same one code path. A server
 *      launched for session A may not accept session B's dump, and a server
 *      bound to nothing may not accept a bare claim — "unbound" is a refusal,
 *      not a wildcard. A host that lets a model pick the session id it writes
 *      under has handed the model the ability to write into another session's
 *      day.
 *
 *      **The lazy bind, added 2026-09-04.** Measured on the live host: Claude
 *      Code registers an MCP server from a STATIC config (command, args, env),
 *      so `--session` never arrives and every dump for the whole run was
 *      refused `no-bound-session`. So a server launched without one may bind
 *      ONCE, from the model's claim, and only when the claim is CORROBORATED by
 *      host state the model cannot write: `adapters/sessions.ts`'s registry,
 *      written by the hooks, must hold that id, it must be live, and its scope
 *      must be this server's scope. The first valid claim binds for the
 *      process's lifetime; a second, different id is refused exactly as it
 *      always was. The explicit `--session` path is unchanged and still wins:
 *      a server told which session it is never consults the registry.
 *
 *      **Claude Desktop binds per call** (2026-09-30). One server there serves
 *      every chat, so a bind frozen for the process would file every chat under
 *      the first. A Desktop call binds the live Desktop session it names, or —
 *      naming none — the most recent one, and says so; its `wake` tool writes
 *      the registry record the hooks would have (`bindDesktopCall`, `wakeTool`).
 *   2. **Stand-down over the wire** (§5 G5, scar E7/§2.4). Under observer every
 *      tool returns a result that SAYS it stood down, plus telemetry. A silent
 *      no-op would be indistinguishable from a broken server, which is the
 *      exact failure §2.4 records.
 *   3. **Owner-scoped confidentiality** (§5 G6). The host is the only thing
 *      that knows whose session this is; it says so at construction, and the
 *      value travels into `Recall`'s own owner logic rather than being
 *      re-derived from anything the model can influence.
 *
 * Telemetry is content-by-reference throughout: ids, counts, tiers, reasons.
 * No body text, no question text, no note text ever reaches an event.

   *
   * A host starts this server once per session and keeps it; the hooks are
   * fresh processes at every event. After an upgrade the hooks run the new
   * build and this server keeps the one it loaded (LAUNCH-STATUS I36). If the
   * new build migrated the store, `SCHEMA_AHEAD` — which is decided at OPEN —
   * never runs again here: this process opened the store before the migration
   * and holds the handle still. So the stamps are re-read here, on the handle
   * it already has (`Store.schemaVersions`: two primary-key reads, no write),
   * and a store or cache AHEAD of this code refuses EVERY tool — `scope` and
   * `status` included — with one sentence, before any tool body has read or
   * written a thing. Behind is not refused: an older store is the hooks' to
   * migrate, exactly as before.
   *
   * It runs BEFORE the scope gate, so in a directory switched `off` it still
   * reads the two stamps — a version number, not a memory, and nothing is
   * written — and every tool there answers this one sentence rather than some
   * `scope-off` and some not: a stale server is the more urgent thing to say.
   *
   * A read that throws refuses too, under its own reason: the point of the
   * gate is to touch nothing when this code cannot know what it is touching.
   * A LOCK is told apart from an unreadable stamp (`db.ts#isLocked`, the same
   * test the hooks' stand-down uses): a store busy past the wait gets a retry,
   * not a reconnect that would not fix it. No refusal writes — the event goes
   * to this process's ring and the host's `onEvent`, never to the store.
   *
   * Entry is not the only moment that matters, because three tools can WAIT
   * between here and their writes: `recall` embeds its question in line, and
   * `note` and `session_end` embed at write time — once per entry, in a loop —
   * whenever this server's counterpart has a live embedder (#187 re-review,
   * N5). So the same verdict is asked again at EVERY store write, by the
   * store itself (`writeGuard`, installed in the constructor), and `recall`
   * also asks it right after its await (#187 review, MAJOR-3), before
   * `deliberateRecall` and the host-state line its handle path writes.

   *
   * It is not written into the SESSION's record, which is where the owner's

   *
   * An observer writes nothing, this included — and nothing is written while
   * this directory is set `off` or `paused` (#187 review, MAJOR-2): the refusal
   * there says "nothing is recorded or read here", the hooks write no session
   * record there (claude-code CONTRACT §19), and a notice could not reach that

   * it never keeps the process alive) does two things each tick. It pins the
   * record to this process rather than to a pid the OS may reuse after a hard
   * kill (`sessions.ts#serverBelieved`), by touching it. And it re-reads the
   * scope setting (#187 re-review, N2): switched `off` or `paused` since the
   * last tick, the record is taken away and not touched again; switched back
   * on — or on for the first time, for a server launched in an off directory —
   * the record is written. The record's identity (pid, host pid, start time,

   * THE HANDLE-EXPANSION CREDIT SEAM (LAUNCH-STATUS G50), the tool half.
   *
   * A deliberate expansion BY TITLE read the whole memory and earned nothing:
   * the boundary's credit pass takes its expansions from the transcript, and
   * `recall/reference.ts` credits literal `mem_…` addresses only — a title is
   * counted `unresolvedHandles` and credits nothing, because that module
   * resolves nothing fuzzily and must not start. The resolution belongs to
   * whoever performed it, which is this tool, so this tool records it
   * (`adapters/expansions.ts`) and the hook translates the transcript's own
   * handle with it.
   *
   * EVERY OUTCOME OF THIS PATH IS RECORDED, and the refusals are recorded as
   * `null` — a shadow that translates nothing and, being the newest answer,
   * overrides an earlier resolution of the same handle IN THE SAME PROJECT.
   * That is not tidiness, it is §5 G6: the log is keyed by the handle, because
   * RESOLUTION is deterministic, but a REFUSAL is not. The owner's own session
   * resolves a confidential title; a stranger's session asking the same title
   * is told nothing. `handle-unknown` and `handle-ambiguous` shadow for the same
   * reason — a title since renamed away, or gone ambiguous, must not go on
   * crediting the memory it used to name.
   *
   * **THE SHADOW IS NOT THE CONFIDENTIALITY BOUNDARY, and the first draft of
   * this method said it was.** A shadow only exists where an answer was given.
   * Three askings get no answer and leave no shadow — a call that never reached
   * `expandHandle`, a `{ handle, question }` the dispatcher refuses as
   * `both-arguments` before this path exists, and a refusal whose write failed
   * (`recordHandleResolution` returns false; it may not throw at a tool). Each
   * of those still puts the title in the transcript, so each still reaches a
   * boundary looking for a translation. What stops them is the SCOPE recorded on
   * every line, which `readHandleResolutions` filters on: another project's
   * resolution cannot answer this project's handle. `scope` is therefore
   * load-bearing here, not forensics.
   *
   * Filtering also retires the price the first draft accepted — a stranger's
   * refusal between the owner's call and the owner's Stop costing the owner the
   * credit — because that shadow now carries the stranger's scope.
   *
   * The `ids` path is out of scope: those are literal addresses the credit pass
   * already sees, and a per-id account of what each resolved to is `perId`'s
   * job, not this one's.
   *
   * Never throws and never changes the answer. A write that FAILED is not
   * symmetrical, though, and the asymmetry is worth naming: a lost RESOLUTION
   * costs credit (safe), a lost REFUSAL leaves an older resolution standing
   * where a shadow should have been (not safe). Across projects the scope filter
   * makes that moot — the older resolution belongs to a directory the next
   * boundary is not in. Within one project directory it is the residual this
   * seam is known to carry.

    //     something did land.
    //   - A handoff was sent and REFUSED (`no-scope`, `too-large`, `not-text`,
    //     `nothing-to-clear`) with no memories → nothing landed, so the refusal
    //     stands and the handoff's own outcome rides out on it.
    //   - Neither — no handoff and no memories → `memories-required`, as
    //     before. So is a `memories` that is not an array: a caller who sent the
    //     wrong TYPE wants to be told. (The published schema no longer marks
    //     `memories` required — the write-up fetch leaves it out, PR #192 m2 —
    //     so this refusal is where the rule is enforced.)
    //
    // AND A FOURTH, 2026-09-23 (B1, owner's decision 4): `memories: []` is
    // "nothing new" WHATEVER happened to the handoff — accepted, minting
    // nothing, and RECORDED, so an honest empty answer is no longer the same
    // silence as no answer at all. Only an explicit empty ARRAY: a call that
    // left the field out has not answered anything, and stays
    // `memories-required`.
    //
    // A handoff that came with it rides out beside the answer, whatever its
    // outcome (review M2: a refused handoff used to turn the whole call into
    // `memories-required`, naming a field the caller HAD sent — new-user
    // finding #12's mechanism, reopened). `nothing-to-clear` — `handoff: ""`
    // where no pointer stands — is a no-op, not an error: the field's own
    // description invites `""` exactly when the work is finished. Any other
    // refusal (`too-large`, `not-text`, `no-scope`, …) sets `isError`, because
    // something the caller sent did not land and resending it can fix that —
    // but the reason stays `nothing-new` and the answer is recorded either way.

   *   3. **Unbound.** The claim must name an id (never inferred — see the

   *      distinguishable only by the id the ask named), and that id must be in
   *      the hooks' registry, live, and in THIS server's scope. Every refusal
