/**
 * The tool registry — and the mechanism that keeps a tool description honest.
 *
 * CONTRACT §5 G2 is the reason this file has a shape at all: **every privilege
 * the tool description states is mechanized.** v1's `note` claimed a
 * high-salience floor IN ITS PROMPT ONLY, with no engine backstop — the single
 * place a stated guarantee had no enforcement. A prompt is not a mechanism
 * (scar §2.6: mechanize invariants, instruct only preferences).
 *
 * So a claim cannot be written into a description here. Descriptions are
 * RENDERED from the registry by `renderDescription`, and every rendered claim is
 * a `Privilege` row carrying `mechanizedBy` — the exact code path that enforces
 * it. `test/mcp.test.ts`'s audit walks the registry, asserts every claim has a
 * mechanized path, asserts each tool's rendered description is the only text it
 * ships, and then EXERCISES the mechanism against a real temp store. A claim
 * with no mechanism cannot be added to a description without failing that test,
 * because there is no other way to add text to a description.
 *
 * CONTRACT §5 G3 is the second shape: **every tool carries an admission test and
 * at least one named negative example.** v1's `thread.open` shipped with no
 * criteria and produced 33 opens and zero closes in 13 days (scar §2.16). Both
 * fields are required by the type, so a tool without them does not compile.
 *
 * What is deliberately ABSENT, and asserted absent by the audit:
 *   - **No tool that writes an IDENTITY ELEMENT.** Superseded by experiencer
 *     authorship (§4): what enters the identity band is decided by promotion and
 *     reinforcement at the boundary, by construction. `chapter` is not one: it
 *     appends to the session's journal, which becomes memory only through the
 *     ordinary gated ingestion. `self_page` is not one either — see below.
 *   - **No `protected.add`.** Dropped with the second-signature queue
 *     (§4, ratified by the module-map Rulings — "settled drops").
 *   - **No tool that writes an entity, a belief, or a revision.** Entities are
 *     born by mention; revision is `updates:` plus arithmetic.
 *
 * **`self_page` is the seventh, added 2026-09-18 (owner rulings 8 and 9,
 * `docs/plan-parallel-rebuild-2026-09-18.md` §2).** It writes the PAGE — the
 * prose "Who I am" that the wake prints — and not the identity band. The
 * distinction is the whole of why it is not the v1 self-store tool coming back:
 * a session amending the page changes what the self SAYS about itself, in one
 * row with versions; it cannot promote a memory, cannot protect one, and moves
 * no strength anywhere. Promotion and reinforcement go on deciding what is true
 * of the self; the page is where that growth is written down.
 *
 * **`dream` is the eighth, added 2026-09-26 (owner decisions, dreaming +
 * consolidation).** Its phases are the dreamer's (`begin`, `propose`,
 * `journal`) plus the session's `launch` and the owner's `decline`. It is not a
 * door into the identity band either: a dream NOMINATES, and only a core lane at
 * consolidation promotes (`sleep/consolidate.ts`).
 *
 * **`reflect` is the ninth, added 2026-09-27 (reflection + core by meaning).**
 * The waking self: usually right after a dream (the dreamer wakes and
 * reflects before it hands back), or on its own. It writes a lived entry,
 * may rewrite the self page from the memories it cites, leaves a morning
 * share, records how a memory feels now and marks what a memory is about.
 * It promotes nothing: a memory it cites comes BACK (a return), and only a
 * core lane at consolidation promotes.

 * tenth so far is `wake` (2026-09-30), offered to Claude Desktop only and kept
 * OUT of this list on purpose (`WAKE`, `DESKTOP_TOOLS`).
 *
 * **`chapter` is the fifth, added 2026-09-04, and it is not a re-opened door.**
 * The dropped v1 self-store tool wrote IDENTITY prose directly; this one appends
 * to the session's own journal, and what it writes reaches memory only through
 * `ingestEpisode`'s ordinary gate, as an ordinary self-kind memory (§13 G6/G8).
 * It exists because the ask said "add chapter N" for a fortnight with nothing on
 * the other end: measured 2026-09-04, zero episode files existed and the model
 * had written eleven chapters as `note`s titled "chapter N". *If a doctrine
 * names the only legitimate inputs, those inputs must be reachable by
 * construction* — the same sentence that justified the ask now justifies its
 * door.
 *
 * **`scope` is the sixth, added 2026-09-10 (owner asks G41–G43).** It is the only
 * tool that writes no memory at all: it reads and sets the HOST's own registry
 * of which directories this memory is for. It exists because the first-launch
 * question the SessionStart hook raises has the same problem every other ask on
 * this host has had — a hook can put a question INTO the context and can
 * receive nothing back (`claude-code/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` gap 7) — and because a
 * directory switched `off` must be switchable back ON from inside a session:
 * every other tool refuses there, so a door that refused too would be a door
