/**
 * MEANING MODE — deliberate recall's second path (Release B, 2026-10-03).
 *
 * `recall` with `mode: "meaning"` answers "what has X been to me", "how have
 * things gone between us", "when was I uneasy": questions about a SUBJECT
 * over time, or a feeling, rather than a fact. Facts mode (`facts.ts`) finds
 * the memories that say something; this one ARRANGES what memory holds about
 * a subject so the reader can interpret it. Recall runs without a language
 * model, so the tool lays the material out and the counterpart writes "what
 * it adds up to" in its own reply, as today's reading (the design of
 * 2026-10-03, `~/counterparts-notes/2026-10-03-deliberate-recall-design.md`).
 *
 * **What an answer is**, in order:
 *
 *   1. A header: the subject, how many chapters and moments hold it, the page,
 *      the other subjects the question named (one line each, to ask for), and
 *      what makes the evidence thin when it is.
 *   2. The ARC: the chapters (`epi_…#N`, `self/chapter-address.ts`) that hold
 *      the subject, ranked by how much of it they hold and SHOWN IN TIME
 *      ORDER; under each, a line of what happened, the feelings recorded in
 *      it — whose they are, side by side, never merged — and two or three of
 *      its moments by id. A long arc keeps its start, its end and its turns;
 *      the stretches between fold to one line each. Moments a session wrote
 *      with no chapter — or under none of its chapters, when their moments
 *      are unknown or come after the last — are an entry per session,
 *      labelled which.
 *   3. Faded moments: a few title lines, labelled, after the arc.
 *   4. Earlier readings: dream gists and reflection entries that touched the
 *      subject, dated. The dream journal stays outside (dream CONTRACT).
 *   5. Still open with the subject: unresolved threads and dated reminders.
 *   6. Recurring: the subjects and feelings that come back across several
 *      chapters, side by side. Nothing names the pattern; the reader does.
 *
 * **The subject.** The question's names, read through the alias index
 * (`Schemas#subjectsIn`), reach their cards' memories (`memory_subjects`,
 * v12); the card holding the most is the arc, the rest are one-liners. "us"
 * is the memories marked `about: us`. A question about feeling
 * (`recall/feeling-ask.ts#readFeelingAsk`, ranked) with no card is answered
 * by the stamps that match it — word, core, whose; with a card, it keeps the
 * chapters where the card's moments carry the feeling. Nothing named and no
 * feeling: the question's rarer words (BM25) and its meaning (the in-line
 * vector) find the moments, and the answer says no card named it.
 *
 * **What it never does.** It writes nothing (no physics, no memory, no host
 * state): a search credits nothing. Opening a moment by id, or quoting one
 * the caller was shown (`MeaningResult.shown`), is what credits. Confidential
 * material is left out of a non-owner's answer SILENTLY — not counted, not
 * hinted at (§9.1 G5's list rule). Corrected (archived), superseded and
 * removed memories are not moments. Ambient recall is untouched.
 *
 * **Reads, bounded.** Indexed reads only: `memoriesNaming`, `feelingsOn`,
 * `list` + `row`, `copiesOf`, `memoriesOfSession` for the chapters shown,
 * one prose read per subject memory (the `unresolved` flag). No scan of
 * every memory's prose.
