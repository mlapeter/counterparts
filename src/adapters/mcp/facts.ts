/**
 * FACTS MODE — `recall` with `mode: "facts"` (Release B of deliberate recall,
 * 2026-10-03; design `~/counterparts-notes/2026-10-03-deliberate-recall-
 * design.md`, held lightly and revisited after a few days of use).
 *
 * A question asked on purpose gets EVERY memory it matches, by any of four
 * ways, ranked by how strongly it matched:
 *
 *   - **words** — every memory sharing a content word with the question (the
 *     token index, every hit: `store.search` with a limit of the word's own
 *     document count), each word weighted by its rarity (`cues.ts#
 *     informativeness`); the score is the share of the question's rarity a
 *     memory holds, shaded by how much of it (BM25 within the word);
 *   - **meaning** — the `FACTS_MEANING_CAP` nearest by the question's
 *     embedding, above the floor ambient recall uses for this embedder
 *     (`recall/tunables.ts#semanticTuning`, inline path);
 *   - **subjects** — every memory linked to an entity card the question names
 *     (`schemas#subjectsIn` → `store.memoriesNaming`, the v12 links), weighted
 *     by how rare the card is;
 *   - **time** — a window the question names (`recall/time-ask.ts`) FILTERS:
 *     only memories inside it, by when the thing happened (`occurred_on`) or,
 *     with no event date, when it was learned (and the line says which), plus a
 *     count of the matches outside it. A question that is only time ("what
 *     happened last week?") answers with everything in the window. An event
 *     anchor ("around the cut-over") is resolved by searching the phrase and
 *     taking the top match's date, shown in the header; "the last session" is
 *     the session the wake's "Last here" names (else the newest here), and its
 *     own rows lead.
 *
 * A memory matched several ways scores the sum, so it ranks higher; recency
 * only breaks ties. Nothing here calls `Recall.build()` — this is its own
 * path, with its own pool and its own ranking, and tuning ambient recall does
 * not move it (nor the reverse).
 *
 * REBUILT HERE, not inherited from the ambient path: a chapter and its own
 * copy are one result (the chapter); a near-duplicate of a result already
 * kept is left out (`NEAR_DUPLICATE`, token overlap); the self page and the
 * handoffs are never results; a chapter is labeled journal; a confidential
 * memory is left out of a non-owner's list, silently (counted on the durable
 * row only).
 *
 * FOLDING. Each result is the CURRENT version of a fact. Earlier versions are
 * folded under it: in-place revisions (`versions` rows whose words differ)
 * and memories it settled as `changed` (a contradiction pair) — an earlier
 * one that matched brings its current one in as the result. Corrected
 * versions are hidden and counted. An `open` pair says "disagrees with", an
 * unsettled older one "may be out of date".
 *
 * FADED. A matched memory that has kept `deliberate.ts#FADED_RETAINED` of
 * its strength or less (it was not used for a long while; `hasFaded`, the
 * rule meaning mode uses too) is listed AFTER the main results, a title line
 * each, labeled faded — never in the main slots. Journal chapters and schemas
 * never fade here. Opening one by id credits it, which brings it back.
 *
 * THE ANSWER (what `renderFacts` writes; the server ships it as `answer`):
 *
 *   12 match · showing 10 · 2 more → page 2 · 3 faded, listed after
 *   time: last week → 09-21..09-27, stretched 2 days each side · 4 more match outside it
 *   about: Han
 *   may not be everything: meaning search hit its cap (100) · 3 weak matches not shown
 *
 *   1. Gym moved to 6am · mem_… · words, subject
 *      you said · done · happened 09-28
 *      learned 09-28 in ~/counterparts · session a1b2c3d4 · CURRENT
 *      earlier: "gym at 7" (learned 09-12), changed 09-28 · mem_…
 *      <the body whole when short, else a 300-character excerpt>
 *
 *   faded (3):
 *   - Old gym schedule · 2026-06-02 · mem_… · faded
 *
 * The header counts DISTINCT facts (folded versions are not counted apart).
 * "may not be everything" is said only when a cap cut or a weak tail was left
 * out, with the reason. `page: N` pages in a stable order. Unknown fields say
 * so ("speaker unknown"): most rows predate v12. The whole answer stays under
 * `RECALL_RESULT_CHARS`.
 *
 * Pure: reads only, writes nothing — the console's `ask` runs it on a
 * read-only store. NO MODEL CALL.
