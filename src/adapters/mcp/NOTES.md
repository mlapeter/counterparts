# `adapters/mcp/` — NOTES

*Decisions taken while building, and the ones deliberately left open. Working
defaults, revisable without ceremony (constitution 13).*

## Built

`protocol.ts` (JSON-RPC 2.0 framing) · `tools.ts` (the registry that makes a
description auditable) · `deliberate.ts` (the deeper look) · `server.ts` (message
dispatch and the four tools) · `stdio.ts` (the pump) · `bin/serve.ts` (entry).
No SDK, no dependency: the wire is ~160 lines because newline-delimited JSON-RPC
is a small thing to write and a large thing to depend on.

## Four tools, and why not three

The contract says three verbs. `session_end` is the fourth because
`claude-code/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7 filed a live gap: the boundary raises an
Stop ask into the model's context, and a hook cannot receive the answer.
In this host, the return channel is a tool. Without it, `Counterpart.submitSessionEnd`
— the primary path by which memory is supposed to form — is reachable only by a
caller holding the object, and the crash fallback silently carries the whole
load.

It is deliberately NOT a general "write a memory" tool: it is bound to one
session at launch, and it refuses when unbound. That refusal is what keeps it
from becoming the second front door CONTRACT §7 OQ1 warns about.

## Open, and left open

1. **OQ1 — does `note` still need to exist?** Both `note` and `session_end` now
   ship, which is two doors to one room. The answer will come from telemetry:
   `mcp.note` versus `mcp.session_end` counts over real use. If the dump carries
   everything, `note` is the one to drop.
2. **OQ3 — tier name or number?** Shipped as NAMES (`vivid`/`quiet`/`dim`), with
   the meaning of each spelled out in the payload. A number would imply a
   calibration nobody has done (scar §2.8).
3. **Confidentiality has no writer** — see INTERFACE-GAPS §2. Owner call.
4. **Protocol versions** are a hardcoded list. When the MCP spec moves, adding a
   string to `PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` is the whole change; unknown versions already
   negotiate down rather than failing.

## Not built, on purpose

- **No self-authorship tool** (§4 — superseded by experiencer authorship).
- **No `protected.add`** (§4, and the module-map Rulings list it under settled
  drops).
- **No tool that writes an entity, a belief, or a revision.** Entities are born
  by mention; revision is `updates:` plus arithmetic. `session_end` accepts an
  `updates` field on an entry, which is the experiencer DECLARING a revision, not
  a tool performing one — the arithmetic still happens in `physics/`.
- **No `tools/list` change notifications, no resources, no prompts.** The
  capability block advertises `tools` only.

## Host wiring the owner still has to do

`package.json` has no `bin` entry for the server (this build was scoped to
`src/adapters/mcp/`, `src/adapters/cli/` and their two test files). A host
registers it as:

```
bun run <repo>/src/adapters/mcp/bin/serve.ts --session <id> --scope <cwd>
```

`--owner` marks the owner's own session (confidential material is returned only
there); `--observer` stands every tool down over the wire.

## Verified live? No — and the suite says so

Every test here runs against a temp store with a faked stdin. Nothing has spoken
to a real MCP client. Per CLAUDE.md's definition of done, that makes this
**merged, not verified**: the outstanding proof is one real host completing a
handshake, listing the tools, and calling `session_end` at a real boundary.

## The configuration is named the same way everywhere now (2026-09-05)

`bin/serve.ts` read `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` and nothing else, which is
how the cold-stranger critic of 2026-09-04 came to embed on the owner's key: the
store was redirected with `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR` and the credentials were not,
because there was no way to redirect them.

The rule is `adapters/config-path.ts`, shared with the hook, the worker and the
console: `--config <absolute path>`, else `COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG`, else the same
default as before. **The environment variable exists FOR THIS ENTRY POINT.** This
host registers an MCP server from a static configuration — command, args, env —
so there is no command line for an operator to add a flag to; `-e
COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG=…` in the `claude mcp add` line is the only channel, and
`counterparts install --config` prints exactly that line.

Two properties, both deliberate:

- **The store is still not decided here.** `--dir` / `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR` /
  the default choose the store; the configuration answers "whose keys, whose
  embedder knob". Reading `config.dataDir` here would quietly fix half of
  QUICKSTART §10.3 and leave the docs claiming the other half.
- **A named configuration that cannot be honoured refuses the launch** — exit 1,
  the reason on stderr — rather than falling back to a default that, on a machine
  with an install, is somebody else's keys. The server also writes the file it
  read to stderr at every launch, before a byte of protocol: stdout is the wire.
