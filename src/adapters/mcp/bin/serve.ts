/**
 * The MCP entry point. Speaks JSON-RPC over stdio and nothing else.
 *
 * Run by a host as, e.g.:
 *
 *   bun run <repo>/src/adapters/mcp/bin/serve.ts --session <id> --scope <dir>
 *
 * Everything host-specific arrives as an ARGUMENT or a named environment
 * variable, and the session id is one of them when the host can supply it: this
 * server deposits under exactly one session (`server.ts`, refusal 1), and being
 * TOLD which one at launch is still the preferred path.
 *
 * **Measured 2026-09-04:** Claude Code cannot use that path. Its MCP servers are
 * registered from a static configuration — command, args, env — with no per-
 * session substitution, so neither `--session` nor `COUNTERPARTS_SESSION` ever
 * arrives, and for the whole first run every dump was refused `no-bound-session`.
 * The flags below are unchanged and still win; a launch without them now falls
 * through to `server.ts`'s lazy bind against `adapters/sessions.ts`'s registry.
 *
 * `--dir` is here for the same reason `hook.ts` pins the data dir onto its
 * child: the registry is found under the data dir, so the two sides have to
 * resolve the SAME one. Absent, both fall back to `dataDir()` and agree anyway.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is a memory rule; all of it is host trivia (§5 G8).
