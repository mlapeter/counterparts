/**
 * Deliberate recall's ADDRESS paths — a memory asked for by id or by its exact
 * title — and the pieces the two question modes share (Release B, 2026-10-03).
 *
 * A QUESTION is not answered here any more. `recall` with a question takes a
 * required `mode`: `facts` (`facts.ts`) or `meaning` (`meaning.ts`), each its
 * own path with its own ranking and its own result, so tuning one cannot leak
 * into the other. What was here — the question re-tiered off `Recall.build()`
 * into vivid / quiet / dim, the hard gates effort could not overturn, the dim
 * cap, the recent-session lead — is retired with it (the build plan,
 * `~/counterparts-notes/2026-10-03-deliberate-recall-build-plan.md`).
 *
 * **The two kinds of ask never blur** (§9.1 G1). A handle EXPANDS:
 * `store.resolve`, exact title match, and if neither answers, not-found —
 * there is no search fallback in this file, and a test asserts a near-miss
 * handle returns nothing rather than the memory a fuzzy match would have
 * found. Expansion degrading into fuzzy search is how a precise question
 * quietly becomes a vibe.
 *
 * Shared: `embedQuestion` (both modes and the console's `ask`), `provenanceOf`
 * / `provenanceParts` (where a row came from), the size constants, the
 * journal gloss.

 * AN UNBOUND NOTE, PLACED BY ITS TIME (2026-10-01, random-f2's items 4 and

 * since then the server finds its session by its host process at write time
 * (`server.ts#hostSession`). For the older rows, given `spans`, the note is
 * read as a session's when it can be no one else's — `preBindNotes`' rule: it
 * was written in that directory, inside the stretch that session was at work
 * there (turn-ends and held pieces), and inside no other session's — and the
 * words say how it was placed: "session a1b2c3d4 (placed by when it was
 * written)". Nothing is written back to the row. The registry's `startedAt`
 * is NOT a stretch: an idle tab opened early would cover a sibling's note
 * (#307, reverted).
