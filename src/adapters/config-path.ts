/**
 * WHERE EVERY ENTRY POINT LOOKS FOR THE HOST CONFIGURATION. One rule, one file.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-05 there were three answers to "which `claude-code.json`?".
 * `claude-code/bin/hook.ts`, `claude-code/bin/runner.ts` and `mcp/bin/serve.ts`
 * each hard-coded `join(homedir(), ".counterparts", "claude-code.json")` and
 * took no flag; the console looked beside the store and then in the home. That
 * was recorded as LAUNCH-STATUS G1, and it cost two concrete things:
 *
 *   - the clean-room install loop could drive the console and the MCP server at
 *     a scratch install but could not drive THE HOOK anywhere except the one
 *     path its own `$HOME` produced, so "the hook honours a config" was a step
 *     nobody could write;
 *   - an agent or a reviewer on a machine that already has an install could not
 *     run those three entry points at all without redirecting `HOME` — and on
 *     2026-09-04 a critic who could not do that ran `counterparts-mcp` against
 *     the owner's live configuration (its embedder knob, its credentials file)
 *     while pointing at a scratch store.
 *
 * THE RULE, and it is the same sentence for the console, the hook, the worker
 * and the MCP server:
 *
 *   1. `--config <absolute path>`, when the command line carries one;
 *   2. else `COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG`, the flag's equivalent for a host that
 *      launches from a STATIC configuration and has no command line to write
 *      into — which is exactly how Claude Code registers an MCP server
 *      (measured 2026-09-04, `mcp/bin/serve.ts`);
 *   3. else the documented default, unchanged: `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json`
 *      for the hook, the worker and the server; and for the console, whose
 *      `--dir` may name any store, `<dir>/../claude-code.json` first and that
 *      same home path second (`cli/commands.ts#hostCeiling`).
 *
 * Two properties this file exists to keep:
 *
 *   **The default path does not move.** `hook.ts` runs on the owner's live host
 *   at the next hook event; a no-flag, no-env run must resolve exactly what it
 *   resolved before this file existed. `defaultConfigPath()` is that path and
 *   nothing else consults it.
 *
 *   **A NAMED configuration that cannot be honoured REFUSES; it never falls
 *   back.** An operator who names one has said which memory they mean. Falling
 *   back to the default on a bad path is how a scratch run writes into a live
 *   store — the failure direction this whole file is a reaction to. Three shapes
 *   refuse, at every entry point that READS a configuration: a flag with nothing
 *   after it, a relative path (`configRefusal`), and — because the first review
 *   of this rule found the hole — an absolute path to a file that is not there
 *   or does not parse (`namedConfigRefusal`). That third one is the dangerous
 *   one: a mistyped `--config /scratch/typo.json` used to be honoured silently,
 *   read as an absent config, resolved to observer, and then fall through to
 *   `dataDir()` — which on a real machine is the owner's live store.
 *
 *   **An absent DEFAULT stays ordinary.** A fresh machine has no
 *   `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` and must still start; that path resolves
 *   to the observer default as it always did. The distinction is `source`, and
 *   it is why the check is a separate function rather than a line inside
 *   `configRefusal`: `install --config <a path>` goes through the same resolver
 *   and the file does not exist yet — writing it is the whole command.
 *
 * It sits beside `sessions.ts` for the same reason that file does: two adapters
 * need it, and neither adapter may import the other (`mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS.md`
 * §7). A sibling both may import is the shape that rule allows.

 * The hole this closes, reproduced by the review of PR #72 on 2026-09-05:
 * `counterparts-hook --config /definitely/not/here/claude-code.json` exited 0,
 * printed a wake, and wrote a store — because a read error is swallowed into
 * `loadConfig(undefined)`, which is the observer default, and the data dir then
 * falls through to `dataDir()`. On a machine with an install that is the live
 * store. A typo in the one flag that says WHICH MEMORY was the one thing nothing
 * would mention (the same sentence the console's `--dirr` refusal already
 * carries).
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - it says nothing about the DEFAULT path. Absent there is ordinary: a fresh
 *     machine has no config and the hook must still stand up as an observer.
 *   - it is not folded into `configRefusal`, because `counterparts install
 *     --config <path>` resolves through the same rule and that file does not
 *     exist yet — creating it is the command.
 *
 * The file is read here and read again by the caller's own loader. That is one
 * extra read of a file measured in hundreds of bytes, and it keeps this module
 * free of any adapter's config schema: what it checks is "can this be read, and
 * is it a JSON object", which is the whole of what a caller needs to have been
 * true.

 * door: a default-sourced `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` NAMES a store — its

 * the other way into the live machine, and it is.
 *
 * So the same variable refuses the same shape here: the guard armed AND the

 * separate function rather than a clause in `resolveConfigPath`, for the same
 * reason `namedConfigRefusal` is: the console's `rebrief` goes through the

 * line drawn: the guard refuses an implicit default that LOCATES A STORE or
 * WRITES THE LIVE BASE; a number read from the default config is neither.
