/**
 * WHICH RUNTIME RUNS A SCRIPT, and the arguments that say so — the one place
 * that knows the difference between Bun and Node.
 *
 * The sources are TypeScript and there is no build step. Bun runs them as they
 * are (`bun run <script.ts>`); Node runs them with `node-hooks.mjs` loaded first
 * (`node --import <node-hooks.mjs> <script.ts>`), which resolves the sources'
 * `./x.js` imports to `./x.ts` and strips the types. Every command this package
 * writes into a host's configuration, and every worker it spawns, is
 * `<runtime> <scriptArgs(script)>`, with the runtime the one running NOW
 * (`process.execPath`) — so `counterparts install` run under Node wires Node,
 * and under Bun wires Bun. The Bun shape was `run <script>` from 2026-09-03
 * and is `--no-env-file run <script>` since 2026-10-09 (below).
 *
 * The runtime is read off the executable's NAME, not off this process, so a
 * caller that passes a fixed executable (every test does) gets the shape that
 * executable needs. Anything not named `node…` is treated as Bun, which is what
 * every command written before Node support said.
 *
 * **BUN IS TOLD NOT TO READ THE PROJECT'S `.env` (2026-10-09).** Bun loads
 * `.env`, `.env.local` and `.env.<NODE_ENV>` from the WORKING DIRECTORY into
 * `process.env` before any of our code runs, and a host starts our hooks and
 * servers in the person's project. So a project whose `.env` set
 * `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR` or `COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG` could point Counterparts at
 * another store — measured, for the plugin's server, which no `-e` pins (scar
 * §2.13 from a direction the spawner's pinning never covered). A variable
 * already in the real environment still wins over a `.env` (also measured), so
 * the hole was every variable nobody set. `--no-env-file` switches the loading
 * off; Node never had it (it reads a `.env` only when `--env-file` names one).
 * Commands written before this carry `run <script>` alone: they still parse
 * (`parseScriptInvocation`), `doctor` names them, and `counterparts connect`
 * rewrites them.
