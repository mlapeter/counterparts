/**
 * The adapter's configuration and its CAPABILITY REPORT.
 *
 * This file is where scar §2.18 lives — "a guarantee carried by something you
 * don't own is not a guarantee". v1 encoded one host's 9,000-byte injection
 * cliff as though it were physiology and discovered its socket ceiling by
 * watching calls die. Both are host facts. Here they are named, reported, and
 * CHECKABLE — and the core is told what they are rather than assuming them.
 *
 * The rule the CONTRACT states and this file mechanizes:
 *
 *   §4 G4 — every host-dependent limit is discovered or asserted at runtime and
 *   surfaced as a checkable value. `capabilities()` returns one row per limit
 *   with `reported: false` where the host said nothing, so "we never asked" and
 *   "the host said zero" are different records (scar §2.4).
 *
 * KEYLESS (owner, 2026-09-24). The package reads no API key and calls no model
 * API of its own: the Anthropic write-up of crashed sessions, the Voyage
 * embedder, the credentials file and the model seats that fed them were
 * removed. A configuration that still names one of them is read, not refused —
 * the setting is ignored and named in `retired` (see `loadConfig`).
 *
 * And one from observer-mode G5: an unreadable configuration resolves to
 * OBSERVER, never to "encode anyway". `loadConfig` never throws.
