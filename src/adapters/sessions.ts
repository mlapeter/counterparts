/**
 * The live-session registry — host state, shared by the adapters that need it.
 *
 * **Why it exists.** Measured 2026-09-04 on the live host: Claude Code registers
 * an MCP server from a STATIC configuration (command, args, env), so
 * `mcp/bin/serve.ts` never receives `--session`. Every `session_end` call was
 * therefore refused `no-bound-session` and no session's dump ever landed — the
 * authored front door was shut for the whole run while the ask kept going out.
 * The hooks DO know the session id (the host hands it to every hook); the server
 * does not. This file is the note the hooks leave where the server can read it.
 *
 * **It is host state, never memory** (constitution 5). It carries no content: an
 * id, a scope, three timestamps, and a few marks about what this session's hooks
 * have already done — which configuration they read, which host the session
 * lives in (2026-09-30; absent is Claude Code, `hostOf`), whether the
 * first-launch question went out, the wake's sentinel of counts and whether its
 * arrival has been checked. Losing the whole directory costs a lazy bind and
 * nothing else, which is why `store/paths.ts` classifies it `backup: false`.
 * The writes are the host lifecycle's (`lifecycle.ts`) and the MCP door's.
 *
 * **Claude Desktop's chat writes here through the MCP server itself**
 * (2026-09-30): it has no hooks, so its `wake` tool writes the record (host
 * `claude-desktop`, scope `hosts.ts#DESKTOP_SCOPE`) with the same lifecycle,
 * and every tool call from that session refreshes it (`touchDesktopSession`),
 * because nothing else would. A call that names no session binds to the most
 * recent live Desktop record (`latestLiveSession`).
 *
 * **Who may write up whose session** (the binding shape agreed for build 3,
 * 2026-09-30): a runner's OWN record lists the ended sessions it was launched
 * to write up (`mayWriteUp`), written by the launcher and never by a model
 * (`grantWriteUps`); the MCP door accepts a subject only if it is listed there,
 * has ended, and is owed per `owedWriteUps` — and on that path it stores the
 * memories under the SUBJECT's scope, skipping the runner's own
 * (`mcp/write-up.ts`, `mcp/CONTRACT.md`).
 *
 * **The MCP server leaves one note of its own here** (2026-09-23):
 * `mcp-server@<pid>.json`, the build it was launched with, so the
 * UserPromptSubmit hook — which runs the INSTALLED build every turn — can tell
 * a session its server is out of date (`decideUpdateNotice`, at the bottom).
 *
 * **Where it lives.** `<dataDir>/sessions/<id>.json`, because the data dir is the
 * one path both sides already agree on — the hooks resolve it in
 * `claude-code/bin/hook.ts`, the server in `Counterpart.open`.
 *
 * **Neither adapter imports the other.** `mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7 keeps
 * adapters as leaves; a sibling module both may import is the shape that rule
 * allows, and it is the reason this file sits beside them rather than inside
 * `claude-code/`. (True of the libraries; one entry point is the exception
 * today — `mcp/bin/serve.ts` opens its embedder through
 * `claude-code/embed-client.ts`.)
 *
 * Three rules the code below mechanizes:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing here ever throws at a caller.** A hook may not fail the host
 *      (`claude-code/CONTRACT.md` §5 G2) and a tool may not fail on host trivia.
 *      Every entry point returns `null` on any failure.
 *   2. **A session id is a FILENAME, and the MCP path takes it from a model.**
 *      `isSessionId` is the whole gate: one path segment of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`,
 *      never `.` or `..`. An id that fails it is not looked up at all.
 *   3. **Writes are atomic** — a temp file beside the target, then `rename`,
 *      so a reader never sees half a record. Same directory, so same
 *      filesystem, so the rename is a rename.

 * **Full write-ups first, then small ones** (2026-09-29): a full one not yet
 * pointed at TODAY (`pointedToday`, the caller's calendar) goes first; then the
 * small ones; then a full one already pointed at today — so a small stretch
 * gets whatever the day's allowance has left, and one full session nobody
 * writes up cannot hold every small one back for ever. **Within each, least
 * recently pointed at first, then oldest first.** A session never pointed at
 * comes before one that was, and among equals the one that ended longest ago
 * goes first. Without that key, one session nobody writes up would stand in
 * front of every other session in its project for ever.
 *
 * **A small one waits for the whole STORE** (review of #285, S1): the day's
 * allowance is one count for the store, so a small debt is offered only when
 * NO full debt anywhere — any project — is waiting and not yet pointed at
 * today. The cost, named: a full debt in a project nobody reopens holds every
 * small one back until it lapses; doctor's line shows it meanwhile.
 *
 * A small one is eligible when the host's registry KNOWS it — a session our
 * hooks saw start, which is what a person's conversation is; the unbound MCP
 * server's shared `"mcp"` id (remember NOTES §16, n2) has no record.
