/**
 * `fired` — which mechanisms have actually fired, and which have gone quiet.
 *
 * **Why it exists.** Constitution 11: every mechanism is verified in real use
 * after it lands, done means seen firing rather than merged, a silent one is
 * diagnosed before anyone considers removing it — and "the system itself shows
 * what fired and what did not". In September 2026 several mechanisms were
 * merged, tested and then never fired once on the live store, and no surface
 * said so. The read-only inventory of 2026-09-17
 * (`docs/mechanism-inventory-2026-09-17.md`) counted forty mechanisms:
 * twenty-four seen firing, ten never, six that cannot be told either way. This
 * module is the first version of the view its §5 proposed, built ONLY from rows
 * the store already holds.
 *
 * **It reads and never writes.** Every call below is a read; the caller hands in
 * a store it already opened, and every caller in this tree opens it in observer
 * stance. Nothing here appends an event, mints a directory or touches box 3.
 *
 * **Where it sits.** Beside `sessions.ts` and `scopes.ts`, for the reason those
 * two are there: three adapters need it — the console's `fired` command,
 * `claude-code/doctor.ts`'s finding and the dashboard's health panel — and
 * `mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7 keeps adapters as leaves that never import each
 * other. It DOES import `dashboard/registries.ts`, which is a registry rather
 * than a view: that file exists precisely so the list of durable event names
 * cannot be copied without going stale, and a second copy here would be the
 * staleness it exists to prevent.
 *
 * **Three things shape the reading.**
 *
 *   1. **One pass over the log, not one query per mechanism.** `Store` offers no
 *      GROUP BY, so the events are read once — ascending, as `eventLog` returns
 *      them — and grouped here. A read that hits its ceiling says so and reports
 *      its totals as a floor rather than as a number.
 *   2. **Windows are CALENDAR days, in the person's zone** (UTC until
 *      2026-09-25; docs/time.md moved every person's day to local, and this
 *      is a read-only view over moments, so it follows — `Store#zone`). A row
 *      that carries its own `date` (a hook's) is read as written; hooks stamp
 *      that local too since the same day. The lived clock is advanced by the
 *      worker and has run seven lived days across fifteen calendar ones on the
 *      owner's own store, so a lived-day window would silently drop rows. The
 *      `sinceDay` bound is used only to keep the SQL cheap; a lived day is never
 *      longer than a calendar day, so it cannot cut a row inside the window.
 *   3. **Absence is a fact, never a formatting hint.** A mechanism with no
 *      durable evidence is `blind` and says which row would fix it; a stood-down
 *      one is `disabled` and names the decision; one retired with a phase of the
 *      run is `retired`. None of the three is silence, and none is a fault.
 *   4. **What was PREVENTED is read, not only what happened** (2026-09-20, E2).
 *      Until now a mechanism that was stopped at every attempt read exactly like
 *      one that had nothing to do: both said `never`. A mechanism whose refusals
 *      are durable — in its own row, or in another row that names them — and
 *      which did not fire inside the window is `blocked`, and the line says by
 *      what. `REFUSAL_READERS` is still the only place a refusal column comes
 *      from, and it still reads only fields a writer already fills.
 *   5. **Not every mechanism has something to do every week** (2026-10-09).
 *      On the owner's store doctor went amber because two rows "went quiet":
 *      a plain reminder that had simply not fallen due, and the v8 upgrade's
 *      census, which runs once by design. A row with a `cadence` says so — a
 *      ONE-TIME job is `done` after it fires, an OCCASION-driven one is
 *      `waiting` while its occasion has not come — and where the store can
 *      tell whether the occasion came (`OCCASION_CHECKS`), an occasion that
 *      came and went unanswered is the finding, and stays one.

 *   - `blocked` — it did not fire inside the window, and something durably said
 *     why: a refusal landed instead. The difference between "never needed" and
 *     "stopped every time", which nothing could tell before 2026-09-20.
 *   - `never` — durable evidence exists and has never carried a single row.
 *   - `new` — never fired, but its evidence is younger than the window, so there
 *     has not yet been time for it to be a worry.
 *   - `blind` — no durable evidence exists at all. The row says which row would
 *     fix it. NOT a synonym for silent: a blind mechanism may be running fine.
 *   - `waiting` — it fires only on an occasion (an owner's action, a failure, a
 *     reminder falling due) and none came this week; or a one-time job whose
 *     occasion this store has never had. Not silence, and not a fault
 *     (2026-10-09). An occasion the store can SEE came and went unanswered is
 *     not `waiting`: that row keeps its `quiet` or `never` and is named in
 *     `missedOccasion`.
 *   - `done` — a one-time job (an upgrade's) that ran. Never `quiet`.
