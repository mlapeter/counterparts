/**
 * The log — one line per event, to a per-date file, for the processes whose
 * rings die with them.
 *
 * **Why it exists.** Every component keeps an in-memory event ring, and until
 * 2026-09-30 none of the four processes that run them wired its `onEvent`: the
 * hook, the turn-end worker, the nightly run and the MCP server. About 270 event
 * names — some 55 of them `*.failed` or `*.threw` — lived for one process and
 * went nowhere, and the worker and the nightly child run with their output
 * discarded. The durable `events` table keeps the facts doctor and the dashboard
 * read; this keeps the order things happened in, for a week, so "what happened
 * at that Stop" has an answer after the process is gone.
 *
 * **Where it lives.** `<dataDir>/sessions/log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.log`, the date the
 * person's calendar day in the store's zone. INSIDE `sessions/`, never beside
 * it: `store/paths.ts#assertLayout` makes a build that predates a new top-level
 * name refuse the whole store, and the `sessions` entry's own note says new host
 * state goes inside it. Nothing that lists `sessions/` reads a sub-directory as
 * a record (`sessions.ts` filters by name; `pruneSessions` cannot remove a
 * directory), and `test/log.test.ts` holds both.
 *
 * **What a line is.** One JSON object: the moment (`isoInstant`), which
 * process (`hook:<event>`, `worker`, `nightly`, `mcp`) and its pid, the
 * session when known, the event's name, its `ref`, and its data. Written with
 * one append per line, so four processes can share a file without tearing.
 *
 * **What goes in** is `LOGGED`, below, and nothing else. **What a value may
 * be** is the store's rule (`store/CONTRACT.md` §5 G10): ids, hashes, counts,
 * codes, kinds. `clean` holds every string to that shape, so a value that is
 * not one — a path, a sentence, an error's message — is written as its length
 * and never as itself, whoever emitted it.
 *
 * **It never fails its caller.** Every write is swallowed: a log that cost a
 * hook its turn would be the instrument breaking the thing it watches. Observer
 * writes nothing at all.
 *
 * A shared leaf beside `sessions.ts`, for the same reason that file is one:
 * three adapters use it and `mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS.md` §7 keeps adapters from
 * importing each other.
