/**
 * `adapters/cli/report.ts` — the two readings a person actually looks at,
 * rendered for a terminal.
 *
 * ── The finding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * New-user findings #5 (2026-09-21), in the owner's words: "all prompts/
 * terminal instructions should be more user friendly, better formatted, etc. if
 * we can use color for doctor we should." `doctor` and `status` are the two
 * commands a new install is CHECKED with, and both printed a dense block of
 * long unbroken lines with no spacing and no colour.
 *
 * ── The one rule this file exists to hold ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A PIPE GETS THE WHOLE READING, from the function that has always produced
 * it.** A pipe, a test console, a CI job, `tools/install-loop/run.sh`, `--json`
 * — every one of them gets every finding, in worst-first order, out of
 * `reportLines` (and the `io.out` sequence `statusCommand` already had). The
 * laid-out arm is reached only when the console has told us it is a terminal
 * (`io.tty`) or that it wants colour anyway (`FORCE_COLOR`), which is `ui.ts`'s
 * existing split between wrapping and colour.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-22 this rule was stated as "plain output never changes, not a
 * byte", and it was kept. The owner's answers of that day changed the WORDS —
 * the labels, the grades, the summary — so what transfers is the half that
 * still means something: what a script sees is complete, ordered and folded by
 * nothing. The terminal may hide a line; a pipe may not.
 *
 * That is why both functions take the findings/the view rather than the store:
 * the READING is one thing, computed once, and this file only decides how it is
 * laid out. A second renderer that recomputed anything would be a second reading
 * that could disagree with the first.
 *
 * ── Why the grouping and not just colour ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `reportLines` is already worst-first (`worstFirst`), and QUICKSTART §12 says
 * so — that order is kept exactly. What the terminal arm adds is a BLANK LINE
 * between the reds, the ambers and the greens, so that "how bad is it" is
 * answered by the shape of the screen before a word is read, and a message that
 * runs past the width is folded with a hanging indent instead of wrapping back
 * into column zero where it reads as a new finding.
