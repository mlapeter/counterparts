/**
 * `adapters/cli/help.ts` — the console's map, and the one rule that shapes it.
 *
 * ── The finding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * New-user findings #4 (2026-09-21), in the owner's words: "running help command
 * after installing to verify is clunky, it spits out a ton of help commands with
 * very verbose summarys, basically a wall of text." `counterparts --help` was 129
 * lines of dense paragraphs. Splitting it into a short map and a page per command
 * fixed the wall; the 0.2.0 trial (findings #17, #18) found what was left:
 * the map was still a list of every command this package has, written in the
 * builder's words — "Is the background half alive? Worst first, with fixes",
 * "Just a store — a second one, or a scratch one" ("what does that even mean and
 * when would a user use it?").
 *
 * ── The split, as the owner drew it on 2026-09-22 ───────────────────────────
 *
 * THREE pages now, and each answers exactly one question:
 *
 *   - **`counterparts --help` / `help` / no arguments** → this file's
 *     `shortHelp()`: what this is, then the fourteen commands a person actually
 *     reaches for, grouped by what they came to do, ONE short line each.
 *   - **`counterparts help advanced`** → `advancedHelp()`: the maintenance and
 *     developer shelf, plus the three flags every command takes. A command that
 *     exists and is written down nowhere is a command nobody can ask for; a
 *     command on the first page a person will never type is a wall of text.
 *   - **`counterparts help <command>` / `<command> --help`** →
 *     `commands.ts#commandHelp`: that command's blurb, its invocation, the
 *     paragraphs below, and every flag it takes with a sentence each. It works
 *     for EVERY command, listed or not.
 *
 * NOTHING WAS DELETED to make the short page short. Every sentence the old
 * `usage()` carried is either in `COMMAND_BLURB`, in `FLAG_HELP` (so it prints
 * beside the flag it is about), or in `COMMAND_DETAIL` below — the table this
 * file exists to hold. `test/help.test.ts` walks a list of phrases out of the
 * old page and asserts each one still prints somewhere a reader can ask for it.
 *
 * ── Three rules for whoever adds a command next ─────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. **Every command has a short line here and a page there.**
 *      `test/help.test.ts` walks `COMMANDS` and fails on a command that has
 *      neither, so a command cannot be added without help for it.
 *   2. **Every command is accounted for in exactly one of three places**:
 *      `GROUPS` (the short map), `ADVANCED` (the shelf), or `UNLISTED` — which
 *      demands a REASON in words for why a dispatched command is on neither
 *      page. The test holds all four tables to `COMMANDS` in both directions.
 *   3. **The short line is SHORT**: `SHORT_LIMIT` characters of description,
 *      mechanized by the same test. The long version has a place to live.
 *
 * ── No value import from `commands.ts` ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `commands.ts` imports this file, so this one imports nothing but TYPES back
 * (erased at compile time; the same stance `ui.ts` takes). The tables here are
 * keyed by plain strings for that reason, and the totality check that ties them
 * to `COMMANDS` lives in the test, where both sides can be named at once.
 */

/**
 * The longest a short line's DESCRIPTION may be. Mechanized in the test.
 *
 * It was 60 until 2026-09-22, when the owner wrote the fourteen lines of the
 * short page himself and the longest of them — `install`'s — came to 73. The
 * limit is a tripwire against a description growing into a paragraph, not a
 * layout rule, so it moved to fit the page he wrote rather than the page being
 * re-wrapped to fit it. `self-page` is the one line he wrote as TWO, and
 * `SHORT` therefore takes an array where a single line will not do.

 * on it, they landed with piece A+B, and the tripwire in `test/help.test.ts`
 * is what made taking them off a step nobody could forget. The mechanism stays
 * for the next time a map is written ahead of a command — it holds this list to
 * `COMMANDS` in both directions, so a name listed and not dispatched must be

 * of a page somebody has already asked for and can be a sentence long; this is
 * a row in a list, and its whole value is that the eye can cross it without
 * stopping.
 *
 * The fourteen lines of `GROUPS` are the owner's own words, 2026-09-22, and
 * `docs/new-user-findings.md` § "The screens" renders them as the acceptance
 * criterion — a builder matches that page, then keeps the facts the old one
 * carried. An entry is an ARRAY only where he wrote two lines.
