/**
 * The `counterparts` command surface.
 *
 * **Brain analog: none, deliberately** (CONTRACT §2). Humans have no console on
 * their own memory — no inspection of every unfalsifiable anchor, no deliberate
 * erasure, no export. This module is the improvement over the biological
 * original that constitution lines 4 and 6 promise: the self is governed and
 * owner-visible, and the owner owns the data.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything below:
 *
 *   1. **Owner operations never run under observer.** An instrument reading a
 *      store may not initialize one, snapshot one, export one, rebuild one, or
 *      remove from one. `status` is the only read-only command and it runs in
 *      the observer stance by construction, so the console cannot train or
 *      deposit anything by being looked at (scar E7).
 *   2. **Dry run is the default for anything destructive**, with an interactive
 *      confirmation, and the plan is RE-MADE after the confirmation rather than
 *      held across it (scars §2.13, E5 — a lock is never held across a human
 *      prompt, and a plan made before a human went to make coffee is a plan
 *      about a store that may have changed).
 *   3. **Reads are pure** (§5 G9). Inspecting the census or the permanent list
 *      writes nothing and logs nothing; loudness about corruption belongs at
 *      mutation time.
 *
 * `run()` returns an exit code and never calls `process.exit`, so every command
 * is testable against a temp dir with a faked console.

/**
 * WHICH FLAGS EACH COMMAND TAKES, and the reason this table exists at all.
 *
 * `parseArgs` runs with `strict: false` — it has to, because a strict parse
 * THROWS and this console does not hand an owner a stack trace. The cost, until
 * 2026-09-04, was that an undeclared flag was silently swallowed: a
 * cold-stranger review typed `counterparts note "…" --dirr <store2>`, got
 * `Remembered mem_… — minted.`, and found store2 still empty — the note had gone
 * to the DEFAULT store, which on a real machine is the owner's live memory, and
 * `--dirr` never appeared in the output. A typo in the one flag that says WHICH
 * STORE is the sharpest edge this console has, and it was the one thing the
 * parser would not mention.
 *
 * So: every flag is declared per command, and anything else is refused BEFORE a
 * store is opened. Two rules, both mechanized in `unknownFlag` below:
 *
 *   1. **A flag nobody declared is an error**, with the nearest declared flag
 *      named if there is a near one. Silence is what made the write invisible.
 *   2. **A flag that wants a value and got none is an error.** `strict: false`
 *      turns `--dir` at the end of a line into the BOOLEAN `true`, which every
 *      reader here treats as "absent" — the same silence one step along.

/**
 * THE ONE DOOR IN FRONT OF A BULK WRITE: the store is named by the `--dir`
 * FLAG, typed on this command line, or the command refuses.
 *
 * **The disagreement this ends (review of #77, 2026-09-05).** Two writing
 * commands landed the same night with two definitions of "named".
 * `migrate-cache --apply` counted `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR`, so
 * `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR=<store> counterparts migrate-cache --apply --yes`
 * walked through its door, reached the conversion and would have rewritten
 * every vector; `repair-dates --apply`, one command over, refused the identical
 * environment, because its guard read `flags.dir === undefined`. Two answers to
 * "did you name the store", in one console, under one `--yes` sentence
 * asserting they agreed.
 *
 * **The owner's ruling (2026-09-05).** `--yes` only ever skips an interactive
 * confirmation. A command that performs a BULK WRITE always requires the
 * `--dir` flag; neither `--yes` nor `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR` stands in for it.
 * An exported variable is a shell's memory of where a store lives, not a
 * sentence somebody typed about THIS rewrite — and on a real machine what it
 * names is the owner's live memory. Ordinary per-memory commands (`note`,
 * `recall`, `remove`, `init`, `install`, `status`, and `verify`'s read-only
 * census) keep today's behaviour: the variable names their store, which is what
 * QUICKSTART §3a teaches.
 *
 * Called FIRST in each writing body, before `storeExists` and before any
 * planning read: a guard that opened the directory before refusing it has
 * already pointed the command at the store it meant to refuse.
 *
 * `label` is the invocation as the owner typed it (`repair-dates --apply`,
 * `verify --rebuild`) and `what` is the one clause saying what it would have
 * done. Returns the refusal's exit code, or `null` when the door is open.

/**
 * WHAT A FORCED WRITE KEEPS FROM THE CONFIGURATION IT IS REPLACING (B1).
 *
 * The keys this command can write but cannot RE-DERIVE: `identity` comes only
 * from `--name`, `embedder` only from `--embedder`, and the ceiling only from
 * `--budget`. A re-install that passes none of the three is the ordinary case —
 * the owner's own 0.2.0 trial is one — and before this the three were simply
 * gone, with nothing on screen.
 *
 * Two rules in the shape of it:
 *
 *   - **A flag always wins.** A key the command line supplies is not carried,
 *     so there is no merge and no precedence to get wrong later.
 *   - **`dataDir` is NEVER carried.** This install resolved it
 *     (`installLayout`), and `--force` over a config that names somewhere else
 *     is exactly how an install is moved. Carrying it would make the move
 *     silently not happen.
 *   - **Settings this build no longer reads are not carried either** —
 *     `credentialsFile`, `models`, `crashWriteUp`, `stopAskShape` (the keys
 *     were removed on 2026-09-24). A rewrite is the natural moment to let them go.
 *
 * It reads the file with `JSON.parse` rather than `loadConfig`: what is wanted
 * is what the file SAID, key for key, not what a loader makes of it — an
 * unreadable or non-object file carries nothing, which is the same answer the
 * ordinary write path gives it.

 * the host and ends on two lines. There is deliberately
 * no second code path that creates a store — that is the rule `start-fresh`
 * already follows ("invent no second install path"), and it is what keeps the
 * refusals (`layoutRefusal`, `throwawayDefaultRefusal`) true on this arm
 * without being restated.
 *
 * Reached only when `ui.ts#isInteractive` says there is a person who can
 * answer: stdin AND stdout are terminals, `CI` is unset, this console has a
 * prompt, and `--no-connect` was not passed. Everything else — a pipe, a
 * script, `tools/install-loop/run.sh`, every test in the suite — goes to
 * `installCommand` and gets today's bytes.
 *
 * ── WHAT 2026-09-22 CHANGED, AND WHY (the owner's items 9, 10, 11) ──────────
 *
 *   - **No step numbers.** `[1/4]` counted questions the person had not asked
 *     to be asked. The screen is now five short exchanges with blank lines
 *     between them.
 *   - **Claude Code is connected BY DEFAULT**, not offered. Ruling 1 of 09-21
 *     ("wire by default, after asking first") is replaced: a person who typed
 *     `install` has asked. `--no-connect` and every scripted console still get
 *     the printed blocks and no edit at all, which is the half that must not
 *     move.
 *   - **The store step is silent** (`quiet`), and says one thing at the end.
 *   - **`install` is the undo of `uninstall --park`**: before anything else, a
 *     parked folder beside the configuration directory is offered back.
 *
 * THE RE-RUN IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON PATH and reads as one: a store that is
 * already there greets you instead of asking your name again, and a connection
 * that is already in place says so instead of being redone.

 * process's PATH is not a login shell's, so a `claude` we cannot see may still
 * be there for the person.
 *
 * Answering "no" means only that nothing here found it; it is said in one line

/**
 * Offer a parked memory back, before anything else happens.
 *
 * The trial's finding #22: after `uninstall --park` the way back was a pasted
 * shell line with an `if [ -e … ] … REFUSING … mv … fi` guard in it. This is
 * that guard, in code, behind a question — and `install` is where it lives
 * because `install` is what a person runs when they come back.
 *
 * ── THE RULES, and every one of them is mechanized in `install.ts` ──────────
 *
 *   - **The parked folder is never opened.** No store, no config, no file at
 *     all: the date comes from the NAME, the size from a walk, the floor from
 *     `preRowsMarkersIn`, which reads filenames. So there is no memory count on
 *     this screen, and the screen says why rather than leaving a gap.
 *   - **Anything that cannot be brought back is named and left**, with the
 *     reason — a symlink, a folder outside this home, a store from before the
 *     rows floor, a folder whose store was parked separately.
 *   - **Nothing moves without a typed answer.** Enter is not "start blank": a
 *     blank start beside a parked folder is a second store the person does not
 *     know about. An empty or unrecognised answer is asked once more and then
 *     stops the command with nothing changed.
 *   - **One `rename`,** and its destination is re-checked immediately before
 *     the call rather than at the top of this function (scar §2.13).

 *
 * THREE NUMBERS, because they are three different facts (scar §2.4):
 *   - `rows`      — live, non-journal rows: the population the column describes.
 *     The journal is not a memory and never earns a band (`sleep/types.ts`), and
 *     an archived or superseded row is deliberately outside box 3.
 *   - `disagree`  — the column contradicts the cache. After a decay pass that was
 *     not cut short by its budget (`sleep/tunables.ts` `BUDGETS.decay`, 20,000
 *     examined rows) this is 0, and a non-zero number means either no pass has
 *     run since this shipped or the store is larger than one pass and is still
 *     catching up, a budget's worth a day.
 *   - `unranked`  — live rows box 3 has never seen. Not a disagreement: there is
 *     nothing to disagree with. "Born since the last pass" is the ordinary
 *     cause and NOT the only one — `verify --rebuild` drops the `ranking` table
 *     with the rest of box 3 (`store/cache.ts#resetCache`) and repopulates only
 *     the index, so straight after a rebuild this reads EVERY live row until the
 *     next decay pass; a decay phase killed mid-body (`CycleKilled`, the

/**
 * `migrate-cache` — convert box 3's vectors from JSON text to float32 BLOBs,
 * IN PLACE, and compact the file afterwards.
 *
 * **Why this is a command and not `verify --rebuild`.** A rebuild recomputes;
 * the thing that would have to recompute here is an EMBEDDER, and this console
 * wires none — so `--rebuild` as the migration means "delete ~13,700 vectors
 * that cost a paid network call each and hope something puts them back"
 * (`cli/NOTES.md`, 2026-09-04). The information needed to write the new shape
 * is already in the old one. Converting is a read and a write of the same
 * numbers, so the migration is a conversion.
 *
 * Six properties, each one a rule this console already has:
 *
 *   1. **The dry run is READ-ONLY, not merely honest.** It opens box 3 with
 *      `openDb`, never `openCache`: the migrating constructor stamps
 *      `cache_meta.schemaVersion`, and on the v3 store this will actually be run
 *      against that one row changed the file's hash under a line that said
 *      nothing had changed. Every question the dry run asks is a `SELECT`.
 *   2. **`--apply` names its store out loud.** The destination is the `--dir`
 *      FLAG, typed on this line, and nothing else — not the default, and (since
 *      the 2026-09-05 ruling) not `COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR` either, which is a
 *      shell's memory rather than a sentence about this rewrite. Then it asks,
 *      `remove`-style, unless `--yes`.
 *   3. **Transactional per batch, and therefore resumable.** One transaction per
 *      `--batch` rows, not one over the whole table: box 3 is the file the
 *      Stop-hook worker writes into, `BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` is five seconds, and a
 *      single transaction over 13.9K rows would hold the write lock for the
 *      whole rewrite. An interrupted run leaves a MIXED cache, which every
 *      reader already tolerates (`cache.ts#decodeVector`), and re-running
 *      finishes it.
 *   4. **A row that will not parse costs one row.** It is skipped, counted and
 *      NAMED, and the walk continues past it — the first version rolled its
 *      batch back and then re-selected the same row forever.
 *   5. **Idempotent, and it refuses rather than pretending.** The batch selects
 *      on `typeof(vec) = 'text'`, so a converted row is never touched twice, and
 *      `--apply` with nothing to convert AND nothing to reclaim exits REFUSED
 *      with the counts, because "I did nothing" and "I converted your store"
 *      must not look the same on a terminal.
 *   6. **Compaction is reachable on its own.** The rewrite frees space that only
 *      a `VACUUM` returns, and `VACUUM` is exactly the step most likely to fail
 *      — it takes an exclusive lock, and the worker holds box 3. So a store that
 *      is CONVERTED BUT NOT COMPACTED is a real state with a door: the dry run
 *      reports the reclaimable bytes and `--apply` compacts them. Without that
 *      door, one lost lock stranded 177 MiB behind an "already converted"
 *      refusal — the whole debt, unreachable through the tool that exists to pay
 *      it.
 *
 * It never opens a `Store`: box 3 only, gated on the file EXISTING so the
 * command cannot mint the box it migrates.

/**
 * THE LOUD REMOVAL, and since 2026-09-22 it has two doors into the same path
 * (the owner's answer 7 after the 0.2.0 trial).
 *
 *   - **The scripted door** — `--confirm`, or any console that cannot ask (a
 *     pipe, a CI job, a test with no answers): exactly what it did before the
 *     other door existed. The plan, then the typed-back id, or the dry run that
 *     says to re-run with `--confirm`.
 *   - **The interactive door** — a terminal with no `--confirm`: it asks for an
 *     id or for words to search for, numbers what it finds, takes a pick, and
 *     asks ONCE.
 *
 * Nothing about the destruction path changes between them, and nothing about it
 * changed to add the second: `removal.ts` still plans, records, darkens and
 * chases in that order, and this is a front door. Nothing about it is fast
 * either, and that is the design: removal has never fired in production in any
 * generation (§7 OQ2), which by scar §2.17's own criterion makes it unproven
 * rather than sound. The friction is what makes it safe to have at all.

/**
 * The one-shot repair for memories minted BEFORE the authored default existed.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-04 on the parallel-run store: 48 authored memories, every
 * one of them with relevance/emotional/predictive = 0, most with no claim — so
 * `sal(m)` was 0 and the lived channel's own deposits were the weakest things in
 * the store. New mints get the floor at the seam (`mint.ts`); these rows never
 * crossed a seam that had one.
 *
 * Three properties, all of them the console's usual ones rather than new
 * inventions: it is a DRY RUN unless `--apply`; it refuses under observer via
 * `OWNER_OPS` (an instrument does not repair the store it is reading); and it
 * touches only rows whose `source` is `authored` and whose `claimed` is NULL —
 * an explicit claim, however low, is testimony and is never overwritten.
 * Archived, superseded and removed rows are excluded: the repair is for what
 * the store is still holding.
 *
 * Each write is two durable acts plus a record: the claim onto box 2
 * (`updatePhysics`), the `claimedDefault` flag onto canonical prose (`revise`,
 * which keeps the prior version — constitution 7), and a `salience.defaulted`
 * row in the event log so the daily can count this run.
 *
 * `claimedDefault` is META, and since the floor (2026-09-20) `content_hash` is
 * `hashText(body)` — so a backfilled row's hash does NOT move when the flag
 * lands, where before the floor it did (the hash addressed the whole serialized
 * document, id and frontmatter included). Either way nothing downstream cares:
 * `sleep/dedup.ts` deliberately hashes the body itself rather than reading this
 * column, and `remember/`'s content-idempotency ledger hashes normalized content
 * and never reads it at all. What DOES move, on purpose, is the revision: the
 * flag goes on through `revise`, which keeps the prior version (constitution 7).

/**
 * THE REPAIR FOR PROBE H — beliefs the nightly dedup pass ate.
 *
 * The bug (`sleep/NOTES.md` §12, fixed the same night): a `type: "schema"` row
 * was an ordinary dedup candidate. An element whose statement is X and an
 * ordinary memory whose body is X — no revision anywhere — formed a same-hash
 * group, `mem_` sorted before `sch_` in the tie-break, and the ELEMENT was
 * archived `merged`. `beliefs(entity)` then read empty: the store had stopped
 * believing something nobody retracted. On a migrated store the DIRECTION of
 * that loss is certain — `tools/migrate/apply.ts` minted every element at the
 * import day while migrated memories kept their v1 birth day, so the memory is
 * never younger and the element always loses — and the COUNT is unknown, since
 * a collision needs two distinct v1 items whose gated text is byte-identical.
 * This command is the thing that measures it.
 *
 * Stopping the bug does not undo it. This finds what it already took and puts
 * it back, through the owner-op seam's `unarchiveMerged` — the one door that
 * un-archives, and only for `archived_reason: "merged"`.
 *
 * Two sources are unioned, because either can be the surviving evidence: the
 * `memory.merged` events whose `candidateId` is a `sch_` id (the owner's
 * read-only check, and the one that still reads true after the retention window
 * trims nothing), and the archived schema rows whose reason is the merge (which
 * survives even if the event log has rolled). Ids the owner removed are skipped
 * — the deny-list answers before this tool does.
 *
 * **What it prints, and the tension in printing it.** `backfill-claims` says
 * "IDS AND NUMBERS ONLY — a repair report is not a place to print bodies", and
 * this one prints TWO things that are not ids: the first 60 characters of each
 * statement, and the ENTITY'S NAME. A person's name is author content as
 * squarely as a statement is, and both are the same deliberate deviation. The
 * difference is what the owner has to decide: a claim restored to the store is
 * a claim the system will state in a briefing, and "restore sch_198628843ffb?"
 * is not a question anyone can answer — nor is it answerable without knowing
 * whose belief it is. This runs on the owner's own terminal, on the owner's own
 * store, at the owner's own keystroke — the same reader who could open the
 * prose file. **The durable record stays ids and numbers only**
 * (`memory.unmerged` carries no text at all, §5 G10): the deviation is
 * console-only. Recorded rather than assumed (see `cli/NOTES.md`).
 *
 * **What it does not touch: the `uses` the merge credited.** The original kept
 * `+1` and keeps it. Taking it back would rewrite a physics count whose band
 * may already have been materialized and whose crossing may already be a
 * durable `band.transition` row, to undo one use. The number is written into
 * the `memory.unmerged` record instead, so the credit is auditable rather than
 * silently reversed — and the merge record itself is left exactly where it is
 * (constitution 7: the history is the point).

 * costs one meta read — right up until the render itself changes: the identity
 * share merged mid-day on 2026-09-04 and could not reach a single session's wake
 * until the following boundary, and an owner who wanted their wake regenerated
 * had nothing to run. This is that lever.
 *
 * Three properties, all of them the console's usual ones:
 *
 *   - It goes through the SAME renderer the sleep step uses
 *     (`core/briefing.ts#selfRenderer`, via `Counterpart.rebrief`) — a console
 *     with a second renderer is a console that can publish a bundle the
 *     boundary would never have composed.
 *   - It refuses under observer via `OWNER_OPS`: republishing is a content
 *     write, and an instrument makes none.
 *   - It advances NO sleep marker and runs no other sleep phase. Decay,
 *     consolidation, dedup and prune stay the boundary's work.
 *
 * The ceiling is the host's, never this file's (scar §2.18): `--budget`, else
 * `injectionBudgetBytes` from the host config beside the store, else a refusal
 * that names both.

 * **It is a HOST-CONFIG write, not a store write**, and every rule below falls
 * out of that one sentence:
 *
 *   - it takes no `--dir` and opens no store, so it runs on a machine that has
 *     not installed one yet — which is exactly when somebody wants to say "not
 *     here";
 *   - it writes `<config dir>/scopes.json`, so `--config` (and
 *     `$COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG`) moves the registry with the configuration, and a
 *     scratch install's scopes are that install's own;
 *   - it is NOT on `OWNER_OPS`, because that list refuses a COMMAND whole and
 *     an instrument must still be able to READ this file — "why did this
 *     session record nothing" is a question a stood-down console has to be able
 *     to answer. The write half refuses in the same sentence an owner op does,
 *     one function down, beside the write it guards.
 *
 * **A relative path is never stored.** The registry is read by processes a host
 * launches from a working directory nobody chose (`config-path.ts`'s whole
 * argument about `--config`), so a relative key would name a different
 * directory in each of them. `.` is the ordinary way to say "here" and is
 * resolved before anything is written; the output always names the ABSOLUTE
 * path it wrote, so the resolution is never a silent one.
 *
 * **A registry it cannot parse is never overwritten.** `--force` is the way
 * through, and it prints what it could not read first: the alternative is a
 * console that quietly replaces a file somebody hand-edited.

 * WHERE THE CONSOLE LOOKS FOR THE HOST CONFIGURATION. One rule, and the only one.
 *
 * `injectionBudgetBytes` is a host capability, and the console has no host — so
 * a command that needs it (today: `rebrief`) has to read the file the host's own
 * adapter reads. That is a real thing the console does, and the documentation
 * said for a while that it did not; a bolded claim a stranger disproved with the
 * second command past the round trip (cold-stranger review, 2026-09-04, issue 3).
 * So it is stated once, here, and every page repeats this and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. `--budget <bytes>`, when given. Nothing is read at all.
 *   2. `<dir>/../claude-code.json` — BESIDE the store. This is the deployed
 *      layout: `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` with the store at
 *      `~/.counterparts/store`, so for a default install (1) and (2) are the
 *      same file. For a `--dir` elsewhere it is the config that names THAT store.
 *   3. `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` — the hooks' own hardcoded path, which
 *      is where `counterparts install` always writes, because `--dir` moves the
 *      store and never the configuration.
 *
 * **Never `<dir>/claude-code.json`.** A file inside the data dir fails the layout
 * totality check (§5 G11) and the store stops opening; the `--help` said that
 * path for a while and it was never true.
 *
 * The caller PRINTS which of these answered, always — a number read out of a
 * file the user did not name is only a surprise while it is silent. `searched`
 * carries the paths so a refusal can name every place that was tried rather
 * than one of them.

/**
 * `doctor` — the reading that would have caught I32 on day one.
 *
 * Read-only, all the way down: the store is opened in OBSERVER stance, box 3 is
 * never opened at all, and nothing here writes a row. The findings, the
 * severities and the fix sentences live in `claude-code/doctor.ts` and are the
 * SAME ones the session-start notice reads, so the terminal warning and this
 * report cannot say different things about one store.
 *
 * Two things it does differently from every other command, both deliberate:
 *
 *   1. **The store comes from the CONFIG first.** `--dir` overrides it and the
 *      environment is the last resort, because the question `doctor` answers is
 *      "is the store the HOOKS open healthy" — and through all of I29 the
 *      answer for the store the environment named was yes.
 *   2. **Nothing it grades comes from this console's shell.** The hook
 *      processes inherit none of it (measured day 0), so a reading that did
 *      would grade a machine the hooks never run on. (Until 2026-09-24 this
 *      was about the API keys, which were read from their file for exactly
 *      that reason.)
 *
 * **And what reading from the config does NOT buy it: an exemption.** With
 * `COUNTERPARTS_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_DIR` armed, this command refuses unless a
 * human named something — `--dir`, or a configuration by `--config` /
 * `COUNTERPARTS_CONFIG`. A configuration found at the DEFAULT path names the
 * live store on every machine with an install, so honouring its `dataDir` past
 * the guard would be the guard's own failure mode wearing a diagnostic's face;
 * the first round of this PR did exactly that and was caught reading the
 * owner's live paths from an armed shell. Two doors enforce it: `run()`
 * (`implicitConfigRefusal`, the same three lines `install` uses) and the dir
 * resolution below.
