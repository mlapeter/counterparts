/**
 * `mechanisms` — the short answer to "is my memory working?", one line per
 * memory mechanism the site names.
 *
 * **Why it exists** (2026-09-25). The owner ran `counterparts fired` and got 57
 * rows mixing the eleven mechanisms with plumbing, sorted by state, in code
 * words — and rows like "NEVER: a copy of the store could not be made" read as
 * alarms when they are good news. This view is the page a regular user reads;
 * `--all` still prints the full `fired` report, unchanged, for the diagnosis.
 *
 * **Whether a mechanism fired is not this file's call** (2026-09-26, an
 * experiment). It asks `mechanism-evidence.ts`, the one judgement the dashboard's
 * lights ask too, so the two can no longer disagree about which rows count. The
 * WORDS and the WINDOW stay this console's own: seven calendar days, the same
 * window the `fired` report counts over, and its own phrasing.
 *
 * The plumbing line still reads the `fired` report's rows.
 *
 * The truth per mechanism is `docs/research/mechanism-audit-2026-09-24.md`.
