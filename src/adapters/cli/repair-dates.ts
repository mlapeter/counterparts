/**
 * `counterparts repair-dates` — giving the migrated rows back their real dates.
 *
 * THE FINDING (PARALLEL-RUN-STATUS 2026-09-04, LAUNCH-STATUS §I7). 12,334 of the
 * 14,529 migrated memories on the live store carry the IMPORT DAY as `learned_on`:
 * v1's traces mostly had no `created` field, and `store.put` defaulted the date to
 * whatever day the importer ran. `bornDay` kept the real age, so the physics is
 * unaffected and nothing decayed wrongly — but every one of those rows now tells
 * the owner it was learned on a day it was not, and #29/#30 had to render them as
 * an upper bound ("by 2026-09-03 ·") because the row does not say which it is.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS EVIDENCE, NOT ARITHMETIC. This tool invents no dates. It reads
 * what the migration already carried into each row's prose meta and proposes a
 * date only where something in the row actually says one:
 *
 *   HIGH    the v1 document said so — a `created` (or `created_at` / `date`) field
 *           carried through as `meta.v1Extra`, or an engram-era id that IS a
 *           millisecond timestamp (`…_1721984400000`), which is a fact about when
 *           the row was minted rather than an inference about it.
 *   MEDIUM  something ADJACENT to the row says so — `meta.sessionRef` carrying a
 *           timestamp or a date (a session id dates the conversation, and a trace
 *           from that session was learned during it), or the `statedOn` /
 *           `openedOn` a v1 SCHEMA ELEMENT carried (a real v1 date about the
 *           statement rather than about the encode — one step removed, which is
 *           what separates this tier from the one above).
 *   LOW     the PATH says so — the source path the trace was read from carries a
 *           `YYYY-MM` or a `YYYY-MM-DD` (v1 filed some traces by month). A month
 *           resolves to its first day and says so; that is a bound presented as a
 *           date, so it is the tier nothing applies by default.
 *
 * Every proposal is checked against a window — no earlier than `PLAUSIBLE_FLOOR`,
 * no later than the import day — because a fourteen-digit number that happens to
 * parse is not evidence, and a "learned" date after the day of the import is a
 * contradiction on its face. A stronger tier's candidate that fails the window
 * yields to a weaker one BEHIND it, and that is counted too (`supersededTier`), so
 * the report's tier counts and its rejection counts add up to the target set
 * rather than to some of it.
 *
 * THREE RE-RUN GUARDS, all of them added after an adversarial review reproduced
 * the failure (PR #67 review §2): a second `--apply` on a repaired store wrote ten
 * no-op revisions and ten events for five rows, and at live scale that is ~12K
 * archived documents recording a change that did not happen.
 *
 *   1. **The import day is PINNED, not re-measured.** `measureImportDay` takes the
 *      MODE of `learned_on`, and after a repair the mode can move to a repaired
 *      date — which both narrows the plausibility window and pulls correctly-dated
 *      rows into the target set. So the first run RECORDS the day it used
 *      (`IMPORT_DAY_META`, and the migration writes `MIGRATED_ON_META` for stores
 *      imported from here on), later runs read it back, and a measured day that
 *      disagrees with a recorded one is a REFUSAL rather than a silent winner.
 *   2. **A row that was already repaired is never a target.** `--apply` writes
 *      `meta.dateRepaired` onto the document; a row carrying it is skipped by name.
 *   3. **A proposal equal to the row's current date is never written.** A re-dating
 *      that changes nothing must not archive a version and claim it did.
 *
 * DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT and `--apply` is the only way past it, exactly as
 * `backfill-claims` works. `--apply` writes through `store.revise`, so the prior
 * document — with its wrong date — is archived into `versions/` first and stays
 * readable: correcting a date is a revision, and constitution 7 says a revision
 * keeps its history. The owner runs `--apply`; nothing here runs it for him.
