/**
 * THE DESTRUCTION PATH. It lives here, in the owner's console, and nowhere else.
 *
 * `src/core/store/owner-op-seam.ts` declares `OwnerRemovalPort` as TYPES ONLY —
 * the store exports no delete, no unlink, no rm, and that absence is the
 * enforcement (§5 G2, §16 G1). This file is the one implementation. A test in
 * `test/cli.test.ts` walks the import graph and fails if any core module, any
 * other adapter, or anything a model can reach imports it. **That test failing
 * is the point**: it is the caller-universality check the contract asks for
 * (§16 G2, earned-mechanism #14).
 *
 * The order below is not style. Every step is a crash point, and at every one of
 * them the memory is either fully alive, or dark AND RECORDED (§16 G10–G11):
 *
 *   1. **Validate the target.** Memory-bearing roots only (§16 G16). The
 *      archive, the backups, the graph and the removal record itself are never
 *      nameable, so a typo cannot point removal at the record of removal.
 *   2. **Read everything that must be read, BEFORE anything is chased** (§16
 *      G13). v1 named this bug by making it: chasing copies first left every
 *      span unidentifiable, so the contamination scan had nothing to match on.
 *      The scan returns **ids only** — printing the matches would re-leak
 *      exactly what is being erased (§16 G15).
 *   3. **`requested`.** If the record cannot be written, NOTHING MOVES. A
 *      removal that happened without a record is the one outcome worse than a
 *      removal that did not happen.
 *   4. **`dark`.** From this moment `Store.deniedIds()` contains the id, and
 *      every consumer that consults it — recall, sleep, associate, prospective,
 *      the cache rebuild — skips it. A restored backup or a stray copy cannot
 *      quietly resurrect it; the stray is skipped and LOGGED, never deleted
 *      (§16 G12).
 *   5. **Chase**, then `chased`, then `complete`. Whatever could not be chased
 *      is REPORTED, never silently dropped (§16 G15: no silent partial success).
 *      Box 1 (the prose file and every archived version file) is chased here;
 *      box 2 (the row, its edges, its prospective windows, the gate rows that
 *      name it, and every content pointer it had) by `chaseRemoved` on the
 *      store's owner-op seam, which appends the `chased` stage inside its own
 *      transaction; box 3 by a rebuild that skips and logs the denied id.
 *
 * The record carries no body and no content hash (§16 G9, scar §2.20): a hash of
 * low-entropy content is brute-forceable, which would make the record of a
 * removal a leak of the thing removed.
