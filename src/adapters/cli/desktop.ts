/**
 * CLAUDE DESKTOP'S CONFIG ENTRY — `counterparts install --host claude-desktop`
 * writes it, `counterparts doctor` reads it (2026-09-30, host groundwork PR B,
 * brief items 7 and 8).
 *
 * Desktop starts its local MCP servers from ONE file,
 * `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, under
 * `mcpServers`. This merges a `counterparts` entry into it and touches nothing
 * else: the file is backed up first, beside itself (`wire.ts#copyToFreeBackup`),
 * every other server's entry is written back as it was, and the file keeps its
 * own indentation and line endings (`wire.ts#sightSettings`, the same reader
 * and refusals `connect` uses on `~/.claude/settings.json`).
 *
 * **The command is the bun-run `counterparts-mcp`, not a `.mcpb` bundle**:
 * Desktop runs bundles under its own Node, and this package is untested on
 * Node. The runtime and the script are ABSOLUTE for the reason `install.ts`
 * gives for the hooks — a host's environment is not the login shell's.
 *
 * **Nothing in the entry says "Desktop".** The server learns who it is talking
 * to from the client's own name at `initialize` (`hosts.ts#hostOfClient`). That
 * matters because Desktop's Code tab ALSO loads this file, and there the
 * client is Claude Code: the same entry must behave exactly as Claude Code's
 * own registration does. A flag saying "desktop" would be false in that tab.
 *
 * **The name clash, and why it is allowed.** In the Code tab a same-name entry
 * from this file wins over `~/.claude.json`'s `counterparts`. Both are written
 * by this package and both name the store the configuration names, so which
 * one wins changes nothing — and doctor says so, and turns amber only if the
 * two point at different stores (`readDesktop`). Measured 2026-10-01: what
 * wins is Desktop's RUNNING server (Desktop mode, shared by its chats), not a
 * Claude Code copy of this entry — so the Code-tab wake names the session id
 * and that server serves a call naming it as the Claude Code session
 * (`mcp/server.ts#claudeCodeSessionNamed`).
 *
 * The home directory is always the caller's (`install`'s `home`, a test's fake
 * one): nothing here reads `os.homedir()`.
