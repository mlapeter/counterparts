/**
 * `counterparts start-fresh` — beginning again without losing what came before.
 *
 * **What it is for.** The owner is about to use this system as a stranger would:
 * a blank store, the QUICKSTART followed literally, every rough edge collected,
 * fixed, and then started over again (plan §2 ruling 6, "cut-over carries
 * NOTHING"). Doing that by hand is five steps
 * (`docs/plan-step3-the-floor-2026-09-17.md` §2 step 5) with seventeen thousand
 * private memories on the other side of a typo. This is those steps, once, with
 * the guards written down.
 *
 * **THE ONE RULE, and everything below is a way of keeping it: it never deletes,
 * and it never opens the old store.** Not for writing, not for reading, not
 * read-only — a WAL store's `-wal` holds committed pages until somebody
 * checkpoints it, and an opener is somebody. The old store is moved by a single
 * `rename(2)` and then left exactly as it was, byte for byte, including its
 * sidecars. Nothing in this file calls `Store.open`, `openDb`, `rm`, `unlink` or
 * `cp` on anything at all. The only mutating call it makes is `rename`.
 *
 * Which is also why the command works on CUT-OVER DAY, when the running build
 * REFUSES the store on disk by name (`STORE_PRE_ROWS`, F5): a rename does not
 * care what floor a directory is on. For the same reason the question "is there
 * a store here?" is asked as **does this directory exist and hold anything**,
 * never `storeExists()` — that one looks for the canonical database by NAME, and
 * the name changes with the floor, so on cut-over day it would answer "no store
 * here" about the very store this command exists to protect.
 *
 * **Why the configuration decides which store, and `--dir` is refused.** The
 * store that matters is the one the HOOKS and the MCP SERVER open, and that is
 * `dataDir` in `claude-code.json` — nothing else. A `--dir` on this command line
 * would be a second answer to "which store", which is the `--dirr` scar
 * (`commands.ts#COMMAND_FLAGS`) pointed at the most dangerous verb in the
 * package. So it is refused by name rather than quietly ignored.
 *
 * **Why the new store lands at the SAME path.** The floor plan's step 5 made a
 * `store-v2` beside the old one and re-ran `claude mcp add`. Parking in place
 * instead means `dataDir` does not move, so the configuration is kept
 * byte-for-byte, the MCP registration (`-e COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR=<store>`) still
 * names the right path, and there is no re-registration step to forget — which
 * was named as failure mode (b) of the clean cut.
 *
 * **What a kill can leave behind.** The snapshots directory is parked FIRST and
 * the store SECOND, so the only window in which the configuration names a
 * directory that is not there is between the store's rename and the blank
 * store's creation, which is two syscalls wide — and the rollback lines are
 * printed BEFORE the first rename, so even a kill inside that window leaves the
 * way back on the screen. A later run reads the ground and finishes.
