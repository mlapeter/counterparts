/**
 * `counterparts connect` / `counterparts disconnect` — the host's two files,
 * edited. (The functions are still called `wire` and `unwire`: they are the
 * verbs for what this file DOES to a settings file, and `install` calls the
 * first of them. The COMMANDS were renamed on 2026-09-22 — "connect" and
 * "disconnect" are what a person does to an AI — and neither name had ever
 * shipped, so there is no alias to keep.)
 *
 * **This is the riskiest code in the package, and the reason is one sentence:
 * every other command in this console writes files that belong to us, and this
 * one writes a file that belongs to somebody else.** `~/.claude/settings.json`
 * is a stranger's editor configuration. It may hold six other tools' hooks, a
 * permissions block, a model choice and an environment they spent an afternoon
 * on. Nothing here is allowed to cost them any of it.
 *
 * So the rules below are not style. Each one is a way this could destroy
 * something that is not ours:
 *
 *   1. **BACK UP FIRST, and say so.** Before a byte changes, the file is copied
 *      to `settings.json.counterparts-backup-<UTC stamp>` beside itself, at the
 *      same mode. A person who does not like what happened has a file to put
 *      back. `connect`'s one line says a backup was KEPT and `disconnect`'s
 *      names it in full — the asymmetry is the owner's (2026-09-22): the person
 *      connecting is three lines into their first install and the person
 *      disconnecting is the one who may want the file back.
 *   2. **EVERY OTHER KEY, AND EVERY OTHER HOOK, SURVIVES.** The merge works on
 *      the INNER hook entry — `hooks[event][i].hooks[j]` — never on the event's
 *      array and never on the `hooks` object. Another tool's entry on
 *      `SessionStart` keeps its position, its `matcher`, its `timeout` and every
 *      key we have never heard of. Hooks on one event run in parallel; ours
 *      goes BESIDE theirs.
 *   3. **IDEMPOTENT, AND REPAIRING.** An entry whose command is already exactly
 *      ours is left alone and no backup is taken — running this twice is not an
 *      event. An entry that is RECOGNISABLY ours but names a different path (an
 *      old checkout, a `counterparts-hook` shim that is no longer on PATH) is
 *      REPLACED IN PLACE rather than duplicated, and the old command is printed.
 *      The recogniser is `install.ts#HOOK_COMMAND_MARK` — the same one `doctor`
 *      reads the host with, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about what
 *      counts as ours.
 *   4. **A FILE THIS CANNOT PARSE IS A REFUSAL.** Not a rewrite, not a rescue, not
 *      "start a fresh one". It prints the block to merge by hand and changes
 *      nothing. The same for a `hooks` key that is not an object and an event
 *      whose value is not an array: a shape we do not understand is a shape we
 *      do not edit.
 *   5. **THE WRITE IS ATOMIC, AND THROUGH A SYMLINK ONLY INTO THE HOME.** Temp
 *      file in the same directory, `rename(2)` onto the target — a kill in the
 *      middle leaves the old file whole, never a truncated one. A symlinked
 *      `settings.json` (a dotfiles repository, an ordinary arrangement) is
 *      written THROUGH to its target, so the link survives; a link pointing
 *      outside the home directory is refused rather than followed, because at
 *      that point this is editing a file in a place nobody said it could.
 *   6. **`~/.claude.json` IS NEVER WRITTEN BY US.** Claude Code owns that file's
 *      shape. The MCP registration goes through `claude mcp add`, which is the
 *      host's own door. We READ the file to decide whether to call it — reading
 *      is what `doctor` already does — and we shell out to change it.
 *
 * The one thing this file cannot do anything about is said out loud instead:
 * a Claude Code session that is already open. Measured 2026-09-21 — after
 * `settings.json` changes, an open session's hooks fire on its NEXT TURN, and
 * its MCP tools appear only after Claude Code is restarted. `sessionsNote` says
 * exactly that, and counts the memory servers still running when it cheaply can;
 * since 2026-09-22 the CALLER prints it, because `install` ends with its own
 * "restart Claude Code, then run doctor" line and two of them on one screen is
 * the finding this round is about.
