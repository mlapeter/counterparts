/**
 * `counterparts install` — the cold-start command.
 *
 * It exists because a stranger's first five minutes were, until this file, five
 * hand-written files: the store, the adapter's configuration, the credential
 * file at 0600, a hooks block in the host's settings, and an MCP registration.
 * Four of those are OURS and one is the HOST'S, and the split is the whole
 * design of this command:
 *
 *   - **Ours, so we write them**: the data directory, `claude-code.json` BESIDE
 *     it, and an empty `credentials.env` at 0600. Nothing here is a host file
 *     and nothing here belongs to another program.
 *   - **The host's, so we only PRINT them**: the `settings.json` hooks block and
 *     the `claude mcp add` line. An installer that edits somebody's editor
 *     configuration without being asked is the same class of surprise as a
 *     memory layer that writes without being asked. `install` never opens
 *     `~/.claude/settings.json` — not to read it, not to back it up, not at all.
 *
 * Three rules the code below mechanizes:
 *
 *   1. **The config sits BESIDE the store, never inside it.** `store/paths.ts`
 *      classifies every top-level entry of the data dir and `assertLayout()`
 *      refuses an unclassified one (§5 G11), so `claude-code.json` inside the
 *      data dir is a store that will not open. Hence the default layout:
 *      `~/.counterparts/` holds the config and the credentials, and the store
 *      is `~/.counterparts/store`.
 *   2. **Nothing existing is overwritten without `--force`.** A second
 *      `install` on a live machine reports what it found and changes nothing —
 *      the same idempotence `init` already has, extended to the two files.
 *   3. **No ceiling is invented** (scar §2.18). `injectionBudgetBytes` is
 *      written only when `--budget` says what it is; without it the config is
 *      written without the key and the printed steps say so out loud.

 * that had lost `test/preload.ts`'s home mock resolved the real
 * `~/.counterparts/claude-code.json` and rewrote its `dataDir` to a temp path.
 * The file is the one the hook, the worker and the MCP server read with NO flag,
 * so from that moment the owner's live memory was a directory the OS was free to
 * delete — and it recorded nothing for three days before anyone noticed. A
 * throwaway store must never become the live default.
 *
 * So: the default configuration file will not be written with a `dataDir` under
 * a temp root. `--config <somewhere else>` is the way through, and it moves the
 * credentials and the store with it (`installLayout`), which is the whole point
 * — a scratch install should be scratch all the way down.
 *
 * THE THIRD CLAUSE, and why the clean room still works: the refusal also
 * requires that the CONFIGURATION not be under a temp root. `tools/install-loop/run.sh`
 * installs into a fake `$HOME` beneath `$TMPDIR` with no `--config` at all, so
 * its default config and its store are both throwaway and both under the same
 * base — a stranger's install, correctly measured, not a live default pointed at
 * a temp store. Keying on the store alone would refuse the loop; keying on the
 * pair is what "the REAL default path" means on a machine where the temp dir can
 * hold a whole home. Test-suite installs are in the same position (the mocked
 * home is minted under `os.tmpdir()`), which is why this is provable only with
 * an injected home outside the temp tree.
 *
 * Not bypassable by `--force`: `--force` says "overwrite the file I named", and
 * the file this refuses to write is one nobody named.

// ── the undo of `uninstall --park` (2026-09-22, item 11) ────────────────────

/**
 * `install` IS THE WAY BACK FROM `uninstall --park`.
 *
 * Trial finding #22, in the owner's words: after `--park` "the undo is a pasted
 * shell one-liner with an `if [ -e … ] … REFUSING … mv … fi` guard. Doesn't make
 * sense." So the undo became a command, and the command is the one a person
 * runs anyway when they come back: `install` looks beside the configuration
 * directory, finds what the park left, and asks.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THIS SECTION EXISTS TO KEEP ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The parked directory is never opened.** Not `Store.open`, not `openDb`, not
 * read-only, and not its `claude-code.json` either. `start-fresh.ts`'s header
 * says why for the store itself — a WAL store's `-wal` holds committed pages
 * until somebody checkpoints it, and an opener is somebody — and the park arm
 * repeats it on screen ("the store was never opened — not even read-only, which
 * is why this arm does not print a count"). A command that brought the folder
 * back by first reading what is in it would make that sentence false one release
 * later.
 *
 * So everything below is `readdir`, `lstat` and ONE `rename`. The date comes out
 * of the NAME, the size out of a walk of the tree, the floor out of
 * `preRowsMarkersIn`, which reads filenames. There is no memory count, and the
 * screen says so rather than leaving a reader to wonder.
 *
 * ── AND THE REFUSALS, WHICH ARE THE REASON IT GETS A REVIEW ─────────────────
 *
 * This moves a stranger's data. Every candidate is refused BY NAME, with the
 * reason, and left exactly where it is, unless it is a plain directory, under
 * this home, holding a store this build can open. The sharpest of them is the
 * symlink clause: `~/.counterparts.parked-2026-09-22 -> ~/.bansai` renamed into
 * place would make `~/.counterparts` a link into v1's live memory, and the very
 * next `Store.open` would open it. That is the one CLAUDE.md forbids twice.
