/**
 * Copying a store safely — the sharpest scar in this adapter's list (§2.11).
 *
 * **A canonical database is never file-copied.** v1 copied its SQLite file with
 * no checkpoint, and it was harmless *because the database was a declared
 * rebuildable cache*. Rescope 1 removed exactly that mitigation: box 2 is
 * canonical now, so the same flaw is canonical-data loss. Here the database is
 * copied by `VACUUM INTO`, which is SQLite's own consistent-snapshot operation:
 * it takes a read transaction, so a writer holding an uncommitted transaction
 * cannot tear the copy — the snapshot contains the last committed state and
 * nothing half-written. `test/cli.test.ts` proves it by holding an open write
 * transaction across the copy and reading the result back.
 *
 * **Scope is asserted against the layout, not documented** (§5 G5). `LAYOUT` in
 * `store/paths.ts` classifies every top-level path as backed-up or explicitly
 * excluded, and `Store.assertLayout()` throws on anything unclassified. This
 * module copies exactly `Store.backupSet()` — so adding a directory to the data
 * dir without classifying it breaks the build, and adding one that IS classified
 * changes the backup automatically. v1's allowlist landed hours before the
 * episode directory existed and silently omitted the canonical journal for three
 * weeks; a hand-maintained second list here would re-create that bug exactly.
 *
 * **Nothing throws at the caller** (§5 G8). A backup problem must not block a
 * consolidation cycle, so every failure is a row in the report.
