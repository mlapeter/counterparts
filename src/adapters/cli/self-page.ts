/**
 * `counterparts self-page` — the owner's door to the written page.
 *
 * The page is the prose the wake now leads with, and constitution 6 says the
 * owner owns the data, in prose they can read and hand-edit in any editor. This
 * is the console half of that: read it, write it whole from a file or from
 * stdin, list what it used to say, and print any one of those versions.
 *
 * **Rendering only.** Every rule about the page — the caps, the gate battery,
 * the durable row, the refusals — lives on the one core seam
 * (`core/self/index.ts#revisePage`), and this file decides nothing of its own.
 * A console that re-implemented a cap would be a second cap.
 *
 * **Reading is allowed under observer; writing is not.** The write refuses at
 * the seam, in the sentence every other write refuses in, which is why
 * `self-page` is not on `OWNER_OPS` — see the note there. An instrument must be
 * able to answer "what does the page say", because that is the first question
 * anyone asks when the wake looks wrong.
