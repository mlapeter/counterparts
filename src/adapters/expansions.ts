/**
 * The handle-resolution log — what a deliberate expansion BY HANDLE actually
 * reached, left where the credit pass can read it.
 *
 * **The gap it closes (LAUNCH-STATUS G50).** `recall/reference.ts` credits an
 * expansion from the recall tool call's own input, and it resolves NOTHING: an
 * `ids`/`handle` value that is not literally a `mem_…` address is counted
 * `unresolvedHandles` and credits nothing. But `mcp/tools.ts` documents `handle`
 * as "a memory id or exact handle", and `mcp/deliberate.ts#expandHandle` answers
 * a TITLE with the whole body. So the most deliberate thing a session can do —
 * name a memory and read it — earned no credit at all. Under-credit, and
 * invisible: the boundary row said `expanded: 0, unresolvedHandles: 1`.
 *
 * **Why a log and not a session field.** There is no per-session "expanded ids"
 * state the credit pass reads; `claude-code/hooks.ts#creditAtBoundary` takes its
 * expansions from the TRANSCRIPT (`transcript.ts#expansionIdsOf`) and slices
 * them by the same turn cursor capture uses. That is the thing to preserve: the
 * transcript already decides WHICH handles this session used and WHEN. This file
 * supplies only the translation — what the tool resolved that handle to.
 *
 * **That is not the same as "credit is not widened", which is what the first two
 * commits of this leaf claimed.** The transcript says which handle and when; it
 * cannot say whose ANSWER resolved it, and this table is shared. So the honest
 * statement is narrower: the boundary credits a memory only for a handle THIS
 * session's transcript carries, translated through an answer given in THIS
 * PROJECT (`readHandleResolutions`'s scope filter) and no earlier than THIS
 * SESSION's own start (its `since` floor). What remains is stated where the
 * filters are: two sessions running at once in one project directory share one
 * table.
 *
 * A list of ids keyed by session would fail twice over: this host launches the MCP
 * server from a static config, so it is usually UNBOUND and has no session id to
 * key by (mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS §6, §8), and a flat list cannot be positioned
 * against the turn cursor, so an expansion from turn 3 would be re-credited at
 * every later boundary.
 *
 * **Neither adapter imports the other.** The MCP tool writes, the Claude Code
 * hook reads, and they meet here — the same shape, and for the same reason, as
 * `adapters/sessions.ts` (mcp/INTERFACE-GAPS §7: adapters are leaves, a shared
 * sibling is what that rule allows).
 *
 * **Host state, not memory, and it says so on disk.** The record is a HASH of
 * the handle, the id it reached (or `null` — see `HandleResolution.id`), a
 * timestamp, and the scope that asked —
 * deliberately no handle text, because a handle IS a memory's title and
 * `store/paths.ts` classifies `sessions/` as carrying no content (`backup:
 * false`). Hashing is what keeps that classification true without editing it.
 *
 * **And the hash is SALTED, per store** (G58, review of #112). An unsalted
 * sha256 prefix is not the absence of content, it is a MEMBERSHIP ORACLE: a
 * title is short and guessable, so anyone holding the file can hash a candidate
 * and learn whether this memory has been asked for by that name — the exact
 * thing the no-content classification promises the file cannot tell. One random
 * per-store value, written once beside the log, turns the oracle back into what
 * the classification already claims: a key that means nothing outside the store
 * that made it. See `expansionSalt`.
 *
 * **A LOST WRITE IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAFE DIRECTION, and saying it was is what the
 * first draft got wrong.** Losing a RESOLUTION costs one handle's credit —
 * under-credit, the direction this repo errs in on purpose. Losing a REFUSAL is
 * the opposite: the shadow that should have overridden an earlier resolution
 * never lands, and the next asking of that handle is translated through an
 * answer it was never given. So the whole file being lost is under-credit only
 * because the resolutions go with the refusals; a file that can be READ but not
 * APPENDED to is the dangerous shape, and it is one of the three in
 * `readHandleResolutions`'s list. That is why the scope filter, and not the
 * shadow, is the confidentiality boundary here: across projects a lost refusal
 * cannot reach another project's boundary at all. Within ONE project directory
 * it still can, and that residual is recorded rather than papered over.
 *
 * Three rules, mechanized below, inherited from `sessions.ts`:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing here ever throws at a caller.** A tool may not fail on host
 *      bookkeeping and a hook may not fail the host. Every entry point returns
 *      a falsy answer instead.
 *   2. **Appends are appends.** One line per resolution, `O_APPEND`, so two
 *      servers writing at once interleave lines rather than clobbering a file.
 *   3. **Compaction is atomic** — temp file beside the target, then `rename`,
 *      so a reader never sees half a log.

 * decides what to KEEP; that is a different question from what wins.) A `null`
 * value is a shadow and translates nothing (see `HandleResolution.id`).
 *
 * **FILTERED BY SCOPE when `opts.scope` is given, and the caller that credits
 * always gives it.** The first draft of this module refused to filter, reasoning
 * that a RESOLUTION is deterministic — one store, one exact-title match — so it
 * could not matter which project's server performed it, and that the refusals
 * were covered by the shadow. That reasoning has a hole, and it is the one this
 * whole leaf exists to close. The log records the last answer ANYONE got, so a
 * session that got no answer at all still reads someone else's, and there are
 * three routes to that which leave no shadow behind them:
 *
 *   - the tool call never reached `expandHandle` (the server was down, or threw
 *     before the resolver ran) — nothing is refused, so nothing is recorded;
 *   - the call was `recall { handle, question }`, which the dispatcher refuses
 *     as `both-arguments` on path `none`, before the handle path exists;
 *   - the call WAS refused `handle-confidential-withheld`, and the shadow could
 *     not be written (a read-only log, a full disk) — `recordHandleResolution`
 *     returns false, because it may not throw at a tool.
 *
 * In each of those the transcript still carries the title, so the boundary still
 * translates it — through the only line in the log, which may be the owner's
 * resolution of a CONFIDENTIAL memory. The shadow cannot cover a case in which
 * nothing was written.
 *
 * The scope is the discriminator that covers all three at once, and it is the
 * same one the server already trusts for session binding (`sessions.ts#sameScope`
 * at `server.ts#requireBoundSession`): a comparison the two adapters disagree
 * about costs a translation, which is under-credit, the safe direction. A record
 * with no scope at all is dropped for the same reason — a line that cannot say
 * where it came from cannot be matched to where this is.
 *
 * Filtering also removes the opposite race the first draft accepted: a
 * stranger's refusal landing between the owner's call and the owner's Stop cost
 * the owner that credit. The stranger's shadow now carries the stranger's scope,
 * so it never reaches the owner's boundary.
 *
 * **`opts.since` is the other half: the asking session's own start.** A project
 * is a place, not a conversation — the same directory carries Monday's session
 * and Tuesday's, and two at once — so the scope alone still lets last week's
 * resolution of a title answer today's typed guess. The credit pass passes the
 * session's `startedAt` from the live-session registry, and a record stamped
 * before it is dropped. Inclusive at the boundary: a resolution in the same
 * millisecond the session was registered is that session's own.
 *
 * What is LEFT is stated rather than hidden: two sessions running CONCURRENTLY
 * in one project directory share one table, so a call that did not reach
 * `expandHandle` can still be translated through a resolution the other one
 * made. And a session with no registry record has no floor at all.
