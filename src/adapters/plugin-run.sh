#!/bin/sh
# The Claude Code plugin's launcher.
#
#   sh plugin-run.sh hook   - the five hooks (hooks/hooks.json)
#   sh plugin-run.sh mcp    - the memory server (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
#   sh plugin-run.sh cli …  - the console, for a plugin user with no
#                             `counterparts` on PATH (commands/doctor.md)
#
# Claude Code runs this with `sh` and the absolute path, so it needs no exec
# bit and no runtime of its own. Its one job is the one the npm install does
# at `install` time and a plugin cannot: FIND A RUNTIME. The install writes the
# absolute path of the runtime it ran under into the host's configuration
# (cli/install.ts, scar 2.18: a host's PATH is not the login shell's); a
# plugin's command is fixed in a file we ship, so the search happens here, at
# every launch, in this order:
#
#   1. COUNTERPARTS_RUNTIME, when set: that executable and no other runtime
#      (Bun, Node, or a Counterparts single binary); one that is not there or
#      too old goes on to 4, not to 2 or 3.
#   2. Bun 1.3+: on PATH, then $BUN_INSTALL/bin, ~/.bun/bin, Homebrew.
#   3. Node 22.15+: on PATH, then Homebrew, /usr/local, Volta, nvm, fnm, asdf,
#      mise. A Node older than 22.15 is skipped, not run (it cannot load the
#      TypeScript sources: adapters/runtime.ts#NODE_FLOOR).
#   4. THE SINGLE BINARY (docs/single-binary.md): one prebuilt Counterparts
#      program for this platform and this exact version, kept in the plugin's
#      data directory, $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/bin/<version>/counterparts.
#
# Bun first, because that is what the npm bins do (cli/bin/counterparts.mjs).
# The entry it runs is the same one those bins run (hook.mjs, serve.mjs,
# counterparts.mjs), so the runtime choice is the only difference.
#
# Bun runs with --no-env-file and --config=<empty-bunfig.toml>: Claude Code
# starts the hooks and the server in the person's project, and Bun would
# otherwise load that project's .env into them (nothing pins the plugin
# server's COUNTERPARTS_DATA_DIR, so a project .env could name another store)
# and run its bunfig.toml `preload` inside them (adapters/runtime.ts). Node
# reads neither unless told to; the single binary is built with both off
# (--no-compile-autoload-dotenv, --no-compile-autoload-bunfig).
#
# WITH NONE OF THE FOUR, THIS FETCHES THE BINARY — once, in the background,
# under a lock, never blocking a hook or the server's start-up:
#
#   - The platform: macOS arm64 (`sysctl hw.optional.arm64`, which a shell
#     started under Rosetta still answers truthfully, unlike `uname -m`), macOS
#     x64, Linux x64/arm64 (glibc), Windows x64 — though no release offers
#     Windows one yet (tools/single-binary/build.ts#RELEASED), so there the
#     message still names a runtime to install.
#   - The program comes from this version's GitHub release: the URL is built
#     here from plugin.json's version and the platform, nothing else. Its
#     sha256s come from .claude-plugin/binaries.json: the checksums SHIP WITH
#     THE PLUGIN — a sum fetched from the same place as the file would prove
#     the transfer and nothing about where it came from. curl takes HTTPS only,
#     redirects included (GitHub sends release assets on to its own CDN, whose
#     host curl cannot pin and has changed before; the pinned sha256 is what
#     makes any host's bytes safe), and no more than the size binaries.json
#     names. The download is checked compressed and again unpacked, in a
#     directory only this user can enter, before it is made executable; only
#     then is it moved into place, in one rename. A file that fails either
#     check is deleted and never run.
#   - A KEPT PROGRAM IS NOT TRUSTED FOREVER. Every full check writes a stamp
#     beside it: the sha256 it matched, and the file's inode, size and mtime.
#     Each launch compares the stamp with binaries.json and the file (one
#     `stat`); the server's start (once a session), a stamp a day old, or any
#     difference re-hashes the whole file (50–80 ms for 100 MiB with openssl,
#     measured on an M3 Pro; a hook's own check is about 1 ms). A program
#     that no longer matches is deleted and downloaded again.
#   - Meanwhile SessionStart says, once, that Counterparts is getting ready
#     (the size, where it comes from, and that memory starts next session);
#     every other hook exits 0 in silence; the server answers the protocol
#     with no tools and says the same in its instructions. A failure gets one
#     line and is retried at a later start (not sooner than ten minutes).
#   - COUNTERPARTS_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=off forbids the download (the message then
#     names a runtime to install, as it did before the binary existed).
#     COUNTERPARTS_BINARY_URL replaces the release URL — for tests; the
#     checksums still come from the plugin.
#
# Claude Code's own native binary does not double as a JavaScript runtime
# (BUN_BE_BUN=1 is ignored; measured on 2.1.295).
#
# Shell built-ins and parameter expansion for everything up to the message,
# plus the runtimes' own --version; the download alone needs curl, gunzip and
# a sha256 tool, and says so by name when one is missing.
