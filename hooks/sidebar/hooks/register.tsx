/**
 * The Counterparts sidebar (v0.2): what memory is doing, in 35 columns.
 *
 * A small brain beside the title, the day, the count and a search box; then
 * what was put in front of Claude for the last message (Memories, said in
 * full; Subconscious, titles only), what this session saved, how often each
 * mechanism fired today, and the last dream; then three rows of switches
 * (Counterparts here, Claude Code's own memory; the view; the brain). Closed,
 * it is one line above the prompt (`strip`) or only a dim tail under it
 * (`quiet`). The design is the round-3 mockups Mike chose on 2026-10-10
 * (`~/counterparts-notes/mockups/2026-10-10-mod-round3/`); ../NOTES.md says
 * where the build differs and why.
 *
 * Where things come from:
 *   - the dashboard (`counterparts dashboard`, http://localhost:4747), read
 *     only: day and count (`/api/pulse`), times fired today
 *     (`/api/mechanisms`), the last dream (`/api/dreams`), a memory opened in
 *     place (`/api/memory?id=`), a mechanism's firings (`/api/mechanism?id=`),
 *     and the event feed that lights the brain (`/api/activity`). Never
 *     started from here;
 *   - the scope registry file the hooks read (`scopes.json` beside the
 *     configuration, read-only, `./scopes.ts`): where this folder stands;
 *   - the memory server over MCP, whichever this session connected: `scope`
 *     to pause or resume, after the confirm; `recall` (facts) for search;
 *   - this session: the recall block the classic UserPromptSubmit hook
 *     injects (Memories, Subconscious), and `tool.call` on note /
 *     session_end / chapter (Saved) and on recall by id (`↗ opened`).
 *
 * The engine lets `$` pass only to functions declared at the top of this
 * file, so everything that touches the engine lives here; the brain, the
 * cells, the feed, the layout and the mechanism table are pure modules beside
 * it, and the body is a Client surface module (`./body.tsx`).
